"One of the things literature does better than almost any other medium is allow us to experience another person’s quality of mind, and sometimes even inhabit it. It follows, then, that every avid reader has a favorite literary character — whether they’re beloved for dastardly deeds, tough-girl antics, sex appeal, or a high snark quotient — and that there are many impossibly good ones out there. After the jump, you’ll find 50 of the best. To be clear: a great character isn’t always one you like , but one that is somehow extraordinary, or evokes some kind of delicious story-feeling in the reader. As always, this list reflects the personal tastes and proclivities of its creator, and many great characters didn’t make the cut , so if your favorite isn’t on here, and them on in the comments. Mary Katherine Blackwood, We Have Always Lived in the Castle , Shirley Jackson “My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood, ” Jackson’s classic novel begins. “I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amantia phalloides , the deathcup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead. ” Strange and funny and constantly sizing up everyone around her and finding them wanting, MKB is the creepy little sister of my heart. @2016 Flavorpill Media .

""" I'm not letting you go. Never again. "" As long as we're together"" - spaceklance Come on, guys! He's the son of Poseidon! - AnnaO Percy does deserve to be #1! He has done many impossible accomplishments but still remained a kind and humble person. Percy is the best! If I'm gonna be honest, I didn't like him all that much. He seemed unrealistically good and unconvincingly selfless. I found his over-the-top goodness to be hard to believe and therefore didn't like him that much. People just like that he's funny and his relationship with Annabeth. I don't get how she isn't number 1, she is hands down the best character in arguably the most iconic book series of all time. Harry and Ron wouldn't last through the first book if it weren't for her, proving the simple greatness her character is way beyond. She is THE role model when it comes to strong and intelligent women all around the world. She isn't just a genius, though. She's extremely loyal and incredibly brave. Everyone can learn from Hermione Granger, and so many are inspired by her. She's the coolest girl in all of books. - girlcool Yuck, she sucks. She teaches girls that you don’t have to care about what other people say and that you should NEVER dumb yourself down for other people and that intelligence is good and useful! If it wasn’t for her Harry and Ron would have died very quickly. She is the best character ever! She has an awesome personality and is just really cool! The whole trilogy was amazing! Even though she made an very, VERY stupid decison getting together with PeEtA becouse Gale would have been a way better choice. I actually wanted to vote for Ron because I knew he would be lower than Harry and Hermione, but couldn't find him and Katniss is a Great character And no you can't roast me because I'm the one that chose the badass pic for her - missyweirdo Now, I don't read The Hunger Games a lot but heck, WHO CARES! Well she seems tough to me so I like her + she sacrificed herself for her sis as a volunteer to save her from being picked to go in so she kinda cool. As a younger child reading the Harry Potter series, I instantly fell in love with this character. She was an eccentric, non-conventional child that instantly struck a chord with me child-me. Was she intelligent? Without a doubt. But she also didn't fit into the stereotypical nerd category, which was definitely a breath of fresh air from the typical nerdy characters. . Like I have said many times she is amazing Love her pretty tough l like her more then Hermione Love how weird she is! - missyweirdo I was going to vote for hermione granger but I knew hazel would be somewhere here so I kept it - pouria_mt She's deep, philosophical and very relatable. - Starsparks She is so inspiring Peeta is amazing and he doesn't need ANYBODY to save him because he can save himself! He is my favorite character out of all the books I have ever read so I don't understand why he is not number 1! Peeta needs no one to save him in fact Katniss actually needs her to save him and by the way Katniss and Peeta can BOTH kick Tris Priors ass separately so don't go dissing on my favorite characters just because you have a poor opinion missyweirdo. Really? Please tell me how an extremely bland and depressed girl and a little sissy boy who always needs his ass saved can kick a way better version of Katniss's ass? You're the one with the poor opinion, stupid fan girl. - missyweirdo Actually Peeta Mellark is the most caring person I know. he's strong and kind and is always thinking about other people. You mean that little brat who needed katniss to save his ass every 5 seconds. Peeta is a little girl, even Sofia The First is more masculine than him! - missyweirdo I like Starflight better I thought Glory was more overrated than Tsunami Yay tsunami I don't see why tsunami can't be a queen cause she deserves it super much How is Tris even on this? - thalia_thatsme How in all the goodness if this earth did anybody ever think that TRIS PRIOR is the best book character of all time? HOW? I know! She's not even in my personal top ten ya dystopian heroines - FavoriteFightingFrenchman She's an annoying stubborn whiner. Sorry. Uriah all the way! HE IS THE BEST DIVERGENT Missyweirdo, you obviously can't tell a good character from a bad one. Tris is so stupid. Katniss would kick her ass in five seconds. Stop dissing on my slay queen and read the books : Sherlock should definitely be 'numero uno' Hell yes I love sherlock holmes Should be number 1! Look above and below this entry. Those are truly layered characters. Not to offend anyone, but Greg is simply not up to par with either of those two . - Cyri Love Greg! Without Greg, I would not be alive today. He saved me! - missyweirdo Greg does not deserve to be on this list! Honestly, his greatest achievement is sneaking into a girl's bathroom! No kidding! He is whiny, and struggles to be himself, ruining everyone's life in the process! He is mean to his friend, Rowley, and avoids this dude, Fregley, just because he has a bad reputation, when in reality, he is brave enough to stick up for himself, when Greg can't even except himself for who he is. get a life, Greg! Favorite character though I'm a boy Best Dragon ever and I'm a boy Dobby is the Best! "" Master has giving Dobby a sock? Dobby is FREE! "" "" You shall not harm Harry Potter"" He is the kindest character ever! Lit oh yeah! Elf swag loves socks My favourite book character. The prettiest and bravest girl I have ever seen in T. V. series Okay, she’s not my favorite, but I voted for her because she deserves to be voted for, does that make sense? She's intelligent and isn't afraid to speak her mind. Not bad for a nineteenth century girl! - Starsparks YESS! I am so glad that Frank is on this list, even if he's not in the top 10. He really doesn't get enough credit. Firestar is the best! He has all the best qualities of a protagonist and hero - Leafstar12 There's too many characters from young adult novels at the top of the list. Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of those characters, but we shouldn't forget about amazing and influential characters like Atticus Finch. - Atham It should be a crime for him to be this low. He's an incredibly well written and respectable character we can all learn from. - Atham I'm guessing there's a lot of youngsters on here, or else Atticus would be a lot higher and all the Tweener/Millennial characters would be a lot lower. - truckturner I love this guy. What he does for Hazel. He's very hard not to love This 17 year old boy with one leg once tried to create a meal entirely about Holland. - Starsparks Hopefully this person is a Goddess Girls fan… A Russian prince who leaves his family to fight against Napoleon's invasion. And what has Greg Heffley done? Sneak into a girl's ablutions. - mcvito Urm. Artemis Fowl is way too cunning for my liking, like Draco Malfoy, but the main protaginist!

" LET’S START WITH an obvious point: this is an impossible list to make. Impossibly subjective, impossibly unfair, impossibly quixotic. When you get right down to it, one could more easily make a list of the 50 greatest names in the works of Charles Dickens than a list of the 50 greatest names in all of literature. But I’m giving it a go anyway, because nothing makes me happier than a battery of “How can not be on the list? You suck! ” comments. A few notes on the process: I’m not including plays , poetry, most children’s literature , or the books of the Bible . Names culled from “the canon, ” such as it is, generally carry more weight than more obscure works. To be truly great, the name must be inherently sublime and also come from a great source. I am aware that “the canon” carries a bias toward dead white European males—DWEMS, as they were lovingly called in the Women’s Studies classes I took in college—and for that I am sorry. Similarly, the 50 names are culturally biased. They reflect the fact that I am a 40-year-old straight white man who went to public high school in the suburbs of north Jersey, who majored in English at Georgetown instead of, say, Sarah Lawrence, and who spent his formative years in New York City. Also, I have an aversion to the Beats. In order to compensate for my narrow worldview, I’ve asked my fellow Weeklings editor Sean Beaudoin for input. Although he is also a fortysomething straight married white male who grew up in the outer suburbs of New York City and spent his formative years in Washington, D. C. he is from Connecticut, not New Jersey, and he thinks Jack Kerouac is rad. I apologize in advance for everything you find wrong with this list, Dear Reader. And with that caveat, here are the 50 greatest literary character names of all time: ~ 50. Moby-Dick An English teacher once told me that Melville was gay and in love with Hawthorne, and the Great White Whale allegory concerns the author’s forbidden and unrequited lust for his friend. So there’s that. Bonus points for being the title of a Led Zeppelin song. And for Moby naming himself after a whale of a character invented by his forebear. 49. Sherlock Holmes, Professor Moriarty This pair of monikers is so integral to the popular culture that it’s hard to separate the names from the Benedict Cumberbatch. But the case for their inclusion is elementary, my dear Watson. Extra credit to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for having the foresight bequeath his detective a name beginning with “shhh, ” which both a) indicates quiet, pensive thought, and b) allows for the alliterative expression, “No shit, Sherlock. ” 48. Binx Bolling With this bizarre invocation, Walker Percy summons the strange and wonderful spirit of New Orleans in three magical syllables. 47. Patrick Bateman “Patrick” is an underrated jerk name and when you imagine our American psycho as a twisted sibling of Jason and Justine, it locates him beautifully in the pop culture. Sidenote: I want to form an 80s cover band and call it The Batemans. 46. Inigo Montoya The perfect name. And not just because I was Inigo Montoya for Halloween last year . 45. Jay Gatsby His name isn’t just great; it’s fabulous . 44. Benno van Archimboldi I’m including the name of the reclusive German author whose mythology constitutes the engine of Roberto Bolaño’s epic 2666 because it’s an awesome name, but also because I’m a pretentious schmuck who wants you to know that he read 2666 . 43. Michael Valentine Smith Grok it. 42. Hannibal Lecter What I love especially about The Silence of the Lambs is that the title is never realized; it’s just implied. Lecter’s analysis of the almost-as-well-named Clarice Starling: “You think if you can save just one, you can stop the awful screaming of the lambs. ” That’s the closest to the title we come. 41. Count Dracula, Victor Frankenstein As with Sherlock Holmes, it’s hard to conceive of a time when Dracula and Frankenstein did not exist, they are so far embedded in the culture. Incidentally, if you’ve never actually read them, these are both much better books than subsequent iterations of the two characters would lead you to believe. The Shelley family in particular is pretty astonishing . 40. Joe Christmas A subtle derivation of “Jesus Christmas, ” as in, “Jesus Christmas, this guy we thought was white is really black, so he must be the killer! ” 39. Angela Argo The well-pierced, punked-out femme fatale of Francine Prose ‘s masterpiece Blue Angel— a novel you should not read when you are about to start teaching an undergraduate creative writing class, as I can tell you from experience—has a name that suggests the titular cherub and the vessel that conveyed Jason and the Argonauts to Colchis, where they fetched the Golden Fleece. Note to Hollywood: make a movie of this already. 38. Huckleberry Finn An American classic. “Huck Finn” is easily switched to make “Fuck Hinn, ” whatever that means. Points are deducted because the Rush song and Winona Ryder’s character in Heathers are both named for Tom Sawyer instead. 37. Scarlett O’Hara, Rhett Butler Gone with the Wind is Exhibit A in the argument for Ho-Hum Epic Novels Make Better Movies Than Great Works of Literature. Either way, Margaret Mitchell came up with some dynamite names. And if you don’t agree, well frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn. 36. Bigger Thomas The only way this name could be better is if it indicated, instead of the ill-fated protagonist of Native Son , the star linebacker for the New York Giants. This would have been in the top five greatest pro football names of all time . 35. Jane Eyre Immediately calls to mind the Brontë sisters, which calls to mind the daughters of Orson Scott Card, who are all named for Brontë sisters, which calls to mind how Card has become a homophobic asshole of Dubai skyscraper proportions, which is probably why Jane Eyre made the list and not 3Jane from Speaker for the Dead . And now that I’ve googled it, I see my memory is faulty, and 3Jane is from Neuromancer , not Speaker for the Dead . OK, then… 34. Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool I defy you to come up with a better name for a cloned heiress to a technology fortune from the future. William Gibson is a fountainhead of cool names. If you’re starting a band, you’ll find a clutch of killer options in Neuromancer . 33. Randall Flagg The best name in arguably Stephen King’s best book. I read this in junior high, and couldn’t come up with the name of another character in The Stand for all the vampires in Salem’s Lot. But this? This is gold! The double Ls and the double Gs. The way “Randall” reduces to “R and all” if you stare at it long enough. Mr. Flagg is the banner of pure evil. 32. Milo Minderbender, Major Major Major Major Catch-22 is one of those rare books whose cleverness is almost too much to bear. Every sentence is constructed with such precision, for maximum comic effect. Example: “His mother was a Daughter of the American Revolution. His father was a Son of a Bitch. ” The sheer density of its comedy prefigures current TV shows like Arrested Development and Archer . Interestingly, the character whose gory death provides the novel’s emotional wallop at the end has a name now familiar to anyone who reads the newspapers: Snowden . 31. Frankie Machine A Sean Beaudoin selection: the hero of The Man with the Golden Arm, whose portrayal yielded a Best Actor nomination for Frank Sinatra. And if it’s good for Frank, it’s good for me. 30. Veruca Salt I am breaking my own “no children’s books” rule, but I can’t fight the seether. Bonus points if there is a successful band named after the character. 29. Uriah Heep Yes-man from David Copperfield and British band who do “Lady in Black. ” 28. Eustacia Vye Don’t take my word for it. “I read a lot of classical books, like The Return of the Native and all, and I like them, and I read a lot of war books and mysteries and all, but they don’t knock me out too much. What really knocks me out is a book that, when you’re all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it… I wouldn’t want to call Somerset Maugham up. I don’t know, he just isn’t the kind of guy I’d want to call up, that’s all. I’d rather call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia Vye. ”—J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye 27. Svengali Creepy, cultish Manson and Koresh-like guy from the novel Trilby , who keeps the young ingenue under his sinister spell. In other words, Tom Cruise sourcing Wife #4. 26. Monroe Starr The only way the name of the Last Tycoon could be better is if Monroe were a woman. Monroe Starr and Jordan Baker should be the lead singer and guitarist in an all-girl band called East Egg. 25. Arthur Dimmsdale On the cartoon Fairly Oddparents , Timmy Turner lives in a town called Dimmsdale. That is the best fake town name ever. Even Gotham City isn’t that good. 24. Bucky Wunderlick Great Jones Street is Don DeLillo’s best novel, and I’ll smash a guitar over the head of anyone who says otherwise. 23. Ramona Quimby I know, I know; I’m breaking my own rule. But Jesus, Beezus, how can we leave Ramona off? 22. Robinson Crusoe Defoe’s legendary shipwrecked protagonist makes the list every day of the week and twice on Friday. 21. Miss Havisham We read Great Expectations my freshmen year in high school, and the teacher looked exactly like how Miss Havisham was described in the novel. Minus the wedding dress. On most days, anyway. Bathsheba Everdene, in a drawing from the original magazine publication of “Far from the Madding Crowd” 20. John Galt The answer to the question posed in the opening sentence of Atlas Shrugged is: “#20 on the list of the 50 greatest literary character names of all time. ” And yes, I do realize that there is some conflict including Ayn Rand on a list of anything “literary. ” 19. Tristam Shandy I never read the book, but this name sounds like a really excellent dive bar of the kind that are quickly disappearing in Manhattan. 18. Lady Chatterly When it comes to her name, I’m a lover. 17. Jeeves Ask him. 16. Dorian Gray A case in which a picture is worth more than a thousand words. The author of this Gothic masterpiece, Oscar Wilde, is himself endowed with one of the greatest literary names of all time, if we ever get around to making that list. 15. Mustapha Mond Said to be a play on words: “Must have a monde , ” or a world, and thus a hodgepodge of the Islamic, the Turkish, and the French: shorthand for the One World Government conspiracy theorists fear. Was Huxley on to something? Or was he just on something? 14. Ichabod Crane I like to think this is the Headless Horseman’s name, although of course it’s not. Washington Irving was a maestro of naming things. He coined “Gotham” as a nickname for New York, and called its inhabitants Knickerbockers, thus inadvertently naming my favorite basketball team. 13. Pierce Inverarity Oedipa Maas’s late lover and possible gateway to the realm of madness. All the words you can make with this: pierce, rarity, invert, verity. Next time, use W. A. S. T. E. 12. Bathsheba Everdene One of the most memorable of Thomas Hardy’s strong, engaging female protagonists, this one from Far from the Madding Crowd . How could a strapping young shepherd like Gabriel Oak not fall in love with a lovely, strong lady with such an awesome name? 11. Lolita Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita. ‘Nuf said. 10. Pip A case in which the nickname and the full name from which it derives are equal parts funny and brilliant. 9. Atticus Finch In the second grade at my daughter’s not-terribly-big school, there are two boys named Atticus. Two! Harper Lee FTW! Pretty much everyone in Mockingbird has an awesome name: Jem, Scout, Calpurnia, Boo Radley. 8. Jean Valjean Who am I? Who am I? It certainly ranks higher than 2-4-6-0-1. 7. Lady Brett Ashley I’ve had a thing for Brett Ashley since I first read The Sun Also Rises back in high school. The inversion—there are certainly more Ashley Bretts in the world than Brett Ashleys—the cropped masculinity of the first name that matches her cropped masculine haircut, the title that she doesn’t really want or need or care about…is this the sexiest female character name of all time? Isn’t it pretty to think so? 6. Big Brother Easy to overlook, but certainly a character—one of the most relevant characters to our experience in this Age of Surveillance . He should feel the wrath of our two minutes’ hate, but also many hours of unqualified appreciation. 5. Holly Golightly Worthy of breakfast at Tiffany’s, lunch at VanCleef & Arpel’s, and dinner at Harry Winston’s. 4. O She’s at once zero and a perfect circle, an initial for climax and symbol for nothing, the sound of sweet pleasure and of unwelcome news understood. None of the other 25 letters—writ in however many shades of grey—could accomplish so much with so little. 3. Ebenezer Scrooge Again, such a part of the culture that we take it for granted, but it’s even more apt than “Sherlock Holmes. ” The last two syllables of the first name hint at “miser, ” and the surname is a twist on “screw. ” Dickens strikes again! 2. Hester Prynne For coming up with the best female character name of all time, I give Hawthorne a A. 1. Humbert Humbert “You can’t make this list and not have Humbert Humbert be #1, ” declares Sean Beaudoin. As usual, Sean is right. And so the top spot goes to Nabokov’s greatest creation and literature’s favorite statutory rapist. He fits right in with the malevolent dictator, willing sex slave, egregious miser, and notorious adulteress who also populate the top six on the list. Which probably says more about me than it does about literature. This is rad, rock star lit upon which I cannot improve. Yet, if I may: Hercule Poirot, Lacey Rawlins, Sal Paradise. RBW future bass player of the Batemans Thank you, good sir. Hercule was on my short list. I am unfamiliar with Lacey Rawlins. No one named Sal can be on a list of best names, unless The Sopranos is involved. I will be useless in the Batemans. My voice is too low to sing along. We’re gonna have to transpose everything, or else find a dude who can sing like Steve Perry. Sherlock Holmes was originally named ‘Sherringford. ’ Not quite as catchy. On an unrelated note, there are a few Holmes stories where Doyle gets Watson’s first name wrong. Due to the first person narration from Watson, it makes it look like he doesn’t know his own name… Not as catchy, but way more British. I’m trying this now, and “Sherlock” is one of those words that sound the same in British and American English. Watson’s first name is Doctor, innit? Doctor John Hamish Watson. I think Sherlock Holmes may be my favourite name in literature. He is a good character, but yeah. I don’t like his name either. Superb, Mr. Olear, despite the hundreds of complaints you will undoubtedly receive from those more pedantic than us. So here is an addendum from a collegial pedant: Undine Spragg – An honorable mention really should go to Edith Wharton for the anti-heroine of her novel The Custom of the Country. Thank you, sir. But I can’t allow Undine Spragg. That is one hideous, hideous name. Hideous it is, indeed. Knowing that hideous names are disallowed, I withdraw the comment. On second thought, hideous names should be allowed. Ebenezer Scrooge is a hideous name. Let us move Undine to the Honorable Mention circle. Hooray for Miss Havisham and Pip , Brett Ashley, Binx Bolling and Humbert Humbert. Do you have any honorable mentions that nearly made the list? Also, Lolita’s last name, Haze, is pretty great. If I were making my own list, I’d have chosen Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange and Oliver Twist. Wow — I just realized DeLarge is his last name only in the movie. Time to reread. Thanks for reading, Kate. I have a long honorable mention list…Poirot was on it…James Bond…more Dickens characters…not sure who else. Dolores Haze, and her mother, Charlotte Haze, also a nice name. These are wonderful choices, although with all the “Lolita” references, I think Clare Quilty deserves at least an honorable mention. And I do want to call attention to the missing “r” in #19 – The book’s title is “Tristram Shandy”. Thank you so much for publishing this – it wraps up my love of names, books, and lists into one delightful package! It should be noted that I suggested “Dim” from A Clockwork Orange” to Greg, and was rebuffed. I maintain that “Dim” may be the simplest, most organically perfect name of all time… It’s the Armbrusters! I’d like to add to the honorable mention list: Magnus Eisengrim and Morgan le Fay…who evolved out of medieval folklore originally but what the hell. Medieval or not, that’s an excellent name. Totally agree. Eisengrim is a good one, too, although the first name is a bit Harry Potterish for my tastes. Thanks for reading and commenting! Sir Launcelot du Lac. Raskolnikov. Ivan Illyich. Ishmael . Jupiter Jones. Ah, I see you spent some time on this! What’s great about Ishmael is that we’re not entirely sure that’s his real name. “Call me Ishmael” suggests that it’s a pseudonym. Which makes it even cooler. I love Melville. His writing to me reads like it was written two weeks ago; there’s a modern quality to it that’s stunning. Thanks for commenting! I love this piece, including all the various comments. Like any list, it’s impossible to narrow it down, but I admire the attempt. And, I totally agree about Melville: it’s more than a little ironic in that he was writing of and for his time yet, was in a very real sense, ahead of his time. Readers can –and should– be surprised by how fresh and vivid his observations are! Have you read his piece about the Galapagos? It’s outstanding. No! I need to get on that! Bertie Wooster. The name has that sort of ring that wants to sustain his last name for longer that it would take Jeeves to mixup his “invigorating” mixture. And even more so when it’s spelled out in full: Bertram Wilberforce “Bertie” Wooster. And yes, I did google it. Thanks for reading and leaving a comment! Any Woodhouse name is awesome! I mean… Gussy Fink-nottle, Roderick Spode, Bingo Little… What’s not to love? : ) Hal Incandenza from “Infinite Jest”, maybe? Also, “Infinite Jest” is, I think, one of the better novel titles of recent years. You rock, Greg Olear! Marnie! So nice to see you. Incandenza is a good one, a bit like a Kerouac/Pynchon hybrid kinda name. DFW was good with titles. “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again” is brilliant. Assuming he came up with them himself, of course… Pingback: Language Blog Roundup: Oscar Hijuelos, Alice Munro, an open letter | Wordnik These are wonderful choices, although with all the “Lolita” references, I think Clare Quilty deserves at least an honorable mention. And I do want to call attention to the missing “r” in #19 – The book’s title is “Tristram Shandy”. Thank you so much for publishing this – it wraps up my love of names, books, and lists into one delightful package! Thanks so much, Rachel. Hmmm…I think I prefer Tristam without that “r, ” at least for my NYC dive bar. And Clare Quilty is of course superb. And, in real life, based on Charlie Chaplin, who had a thing for Lolitas. I really can’t say there’s any need to improve this list, so many of my favourite characters are on here. If I could just suggest that while it was only a Novella, I really loved the character of Lennie Small. His whole story was so horribly painful-beautiful and his end is still one of my favourite character resolutions in fiction. Totally agree. Thanks for reading and commenting! Also a fabulous name: Crispus Attucks Fabulous name, yes, but a real person, and not a character — although he does sound like one. One day we’ll make a 50 Historical Figures Names list, and he’ll be on it for sure! There’s also Eugène de Rastignac from Pere Goriot. And while we’re on the subject of Balzac, there’s also Vautrin ; ) And I’ve always liked the name Inspector Javert. The French names all sound good, because they’re French! Javert is indeed excellent. I chose Jean Valjean instead, but it could have gone either way. Thanks for reading and sharing! –Greg Pingback: http: //www. theweeklings. com/golear/2013/10/08/the-50-greatest-literary-character-names-of-all-time/ | janelawler Wot, no Hiro Protagonist, from Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash? I enjoyed your list tremendously! I agree that Scarlett and Rhett were great names, but remember reading somewhere that Scarlett was originally named Pansy in the early versions of the novel. Yuck…just yuck! I love the allusion in the name Scarlett! It suits her so perfectly. Valentine Michael Smith, not Michael Valentine Smith. Grok it. What about Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin? : ) Lesser known perhaps, but still worthy: Lestat de Lioncourt courtesy of Anne Rice Dondi Snayheever from Tim Powers Was Atticus Finch on your shortlist? I’m glad to see Pip and Miss Havisham, but where is Estella Havisham? I absolutely fell in love with the name after reading Great Expectations in high school. And I’m surprised to see nothing included from Wuthering Heights. It’s full of good names! Heathcliff, Catherine Earnshaw, Hindley Earnshaw, Edgar Linton, Linton Heathcliff, Hareton Earnshaw… If you ever make a part two, I hope to see one of them included! Pingback: Don’t discount the power of a name | alliepottswrites At this moment I am going away to do my breakfast, once having my breakfast coming yet again to read other news. My web page – Indian bridal hairstyles I enjoyed your list a great deal and found myself agreeing with the vast majority of your selections. There is one small correction I’d suggest however. Regarding The Silence of the Lambs, you’re mistaken about the title. It actually appears in the final senstence of the novel which reads: “But the face on the pillow, rosy in the firelight, is certainly that of Clarice Starling, and she sleeps deeply, sweetly, in the silence of the lambs. ” Pynchon used the same trick at the close of The Crying of Lot 49, whose Pierce Inverarity deservedly appears on your list. Thanks for the thought-provoking read. I’ll be passing your list on to friends of mine. I did not know that! The only thing cooler than dancing around the realized title is saving it for last. . Thanks so much for the comment and for reading. Did you honestly exclude Ford Prefect? I mean, come on now, that easily beats out at least Patrick Bateman. Ford Prefect is too made-up-sounding for me. And I always read it was Ford Perfect. True but it’s supposed to be made up – that’s the humour of it. The kind of human-like name an alien would come up with after being on Earth for five minutes. Great list though. I’ll just throw Raoul Duke into the mix. In the words of Bill and Ted – “Most Excellent”. I’m inspired to read! Lest I appear under-literate, I propose the great and pompous Ignatius J. Reilly. Not only a large character but larger than life. A worthy selection, Phillip. Bill and Ted would find it not bogus…at least, not in the primary definition of bogus. Making a list, especially as epic and huge as this one, is a great undertaking. I think the art of the large inclusive list deserves study so I submit for study: http: //www. rollingstone. com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123 Put down whatever list you’re working on and read Tristram Shandy . NOW. It’s the funniest damn book ever written. Not to mention it’s as dirty as Shakespeare. I love that you assume I’m working on a new list. . It was hinted that Nero Wolfe was the son of Sherlock Holmes. If so, his name is way cooler than his dad’s. And what about his trio of hired gumshoes… Saul Panzer, Orrie Cather and Fred Durkin? There’s also Perley Stebbins. When it came to names, Rex Stout knocked the ball out of the ballpark. I don’t believe that any of those are character names. I’m pretty sure they are all players on the roster of the Boston Red Sox in, say, 1915. In addition to Bertie Wooster, may I suggest the names of some of Bertie’s friends, such as Gussie Fink-Nottle, Bingo Little, Tuppy Glossop, Boko Fittleworth, and Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, to name a few. And it’s hard to find a more perfect name than Jeeves. Is Jeeves not on my list? I thought he was. He was on the short list for sure. The other names sound a bit too made-up for my taste, but then I’m often accused of being a fink-nottle. I have to say that I’ve always loved the name “Mycroft Holmes”. . It’s just so unique! I love that one because it sounds like Minecraft Holmes. I propose Lestat de Lioncourt as another literary character with a fantastic name. I love this list. But you left off a personal favorite of mine. Although I probably couldn’t explain why I like the name. Holden Caulfield True words Craig. But at least there’s a quote of his on the list, so that’s some consolation. His colloquialism brings back memories. It really does. Holden Caulfield, you phony! Idie – I was going to comment Holden Caulfield. Stephen kings Misery Chastain? C’mon that’s as original as they come. man, you have guts to leave James Bond out that list. Otherwise a great read! My dogs are always named for literary characters and I’m happy to see three on the list! Atticus is a personal favorite. I’ve also loved Miss Maudie from “To Kill A Mockingbird”. Names from “The Stand” you might have been blanking on: Stu Redman, Larry Underwood, Frances Goldsmith, Tom Cullen , Harold Lauder, and Nadine who’s last name I’ve quiet forgotten. I don’t know that they’d make the list but they’re a good lot. Love the list! Although another great one to add would be Peter Pan, in my opinion. : ) Great list! My personal favorite is Phileas Fogg. : ) Great topic, of the top of my head Holden Caulfield is a no brainer. Also, Paul Attreides and Muad’Dib . Gully Foyle . Samwise Gamgee. Ignatius J. Reilly . Rat Korga …. I guess I could go on forever Ooo ooo and Rooster Cogburn. Ok I’m done. Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell is the greatest. What about Asta Sollilja from Haldor Laxness’ “Independent People”? Sollilja itself means ‘sun lily’. And Lev Nikolaevitch Myshkin, from Dostoyevsky’s “The Idiot”. His name contradicts itself, as Lev = Leo = lion, while Myshkin means mouse. So he’s both a lion, vibrant with his idealism and a mouse, a coward. Along with Holden, how about Phoebe Caulfield? And, from Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, Sweet is a fine name for a good-hearted prostitute. Tyler durden Frankenstein Jean-baptiste Grenouille Awesome, but unfortunately, I haven’t read all those books in which the characters mentioned in your list. I may add these: Peter Pan Tom Marvolo Riddle Lemony Snicket Serafina Pekkala And I love Thimbletack ; ) Who is O or Zero? Is this a 50 shades of grey character? It’s not proving to be an easy search online looking for a one letter name. O is the main character in the book, “The Story of O”. It is the original BDSM book. She is “the willing sex slave” listed in Humbert Humbert’s character description. Aww was hoping for my favorite – Long John Silver. What about Julien English? He was as white bread as his name. You forgot to include John Watson. He’s like, Sherlock’s best friend and assistant in mysteries. How can you not include him? A bit late in the day. Still……. How can you leave out: HAMLET OTHELLO MACBETH KING LEAR ROBIN HOOD TARZAN WILLIAM TELL THE PIED PIPER What about Rebecca? Does she count? Hercule Poirot? Passpertout? Vivian Darkbloom is Nabokov’s greatest name. Thanks for the great list, this is a great source for literary baby names or pet names. I absolutely love this discussion. I would add, simply because I love to say it out loud: Flavia De Luce. An impeccably chosen list and kudos to the many suggestions. So many that if my hon men is already there my apologies. I did not read them all. I submit O’Toole’s Ignatius j Reilly . Artful Dodger? I found some of the names on the list a bit curious as selections. But as the author says, Shakespeare and Dickens, amongst others, alone could each have a top 50 and a complete greatest literary character list would probably be more like 500 names, rather than just 50. So of course there are SO many characters deserving of being on this list who aren’t on it. That said, I really wish there had been at least 1 Vonnegut character included. I myself would probably nominate Kilgore Trout and Harrison Bergeron, if the list had been up to me. My favorite squashed cabbage leaf, ‘Eliza Doolittle’. Bilbo Baggins Mr. Darcy Katniss Everdeen Im related to the Defoes The Gegenheimers are related to the Defoes It’s actually a nice and useful piece of info. I am happy that you just shared this useful info with us. Please stay us up to date like this. Thanks for sharing. Where’s T. S Garp? What about Zaphod Beeblbrox? Ummm…I may be wrong, but isn’t it Milo Minderbinder? Not Minderbender? Hello blogger i see you don’t monetize your page. You can earn extra bucks easily, search on youtube for: how to earn selling articles Tom Joad. just because. Tom Joad…just because. I would like to nominate the wonderfully named retired detective Stacey Olifant, who features in Q is for Quarry by Sue Grafton, of blessed memory. PS I beg his pardon – Stacey Oliphant. Out of interest, why Hester Prynne? Lestat de Lioncourt Boo Radly Did any one bring up Anne Shirley. She is one of my favorites/ I’m gonna call my dog Clint. Then when he runs off I can ask “Where’s my Clint? ” Or maybe Charley. “Can you smell my Charley? ” Both of these are immortal lines from the imagination of the late, great Victoria Wood from the series Dinner Ladies. Might I suggest: Charlie Asher- Henry Sugar- Personal favorite: Edmond Dantes How did Hannibal Lector not make this list? Your email address will not be published.

"Copyright © 2010–2019 ShortList Swaggering their way through the pages of your favourite reads Never trust anyone who doesn’t believe in the power of the imagination. Not our words, but those of William Shakespeare, and, let’s face it, he knew a thing or two about harnessing the fertile properties of the imagination. Ok, we come clean, they are our words – we just thought the old Bard would add some gravitas. You see, we’re attempting to extol the virtues of being cool through the medium of literature. Maybe we should have just cut to the chase. So without further digression, 40 of the coolest cats the printed word has conjured up. Think of them as imaginary buddies you’d want to go for a pint with… Author: J. P. Donleavy Sebastian Dangerfield is a whirlwind of bohemian misadventure. An American of Irish descent studying in Dublin, he is a somewhat immoral beast – relentlessly cheating on his young wife who is trying to raise their infant daughter, and forever drunk – but you can’t help rooting for him. A cross between an Oscar Wilde character and Han Solo, Dangerfield lights up Donleavy’s uproariously lively depiction of Ireland in 1947. Author: Antoine De Saint-Exupéry An astronaut-cum-gardener-cum-prophet, the Little Prince is perhaps the wisest character in the history of literature. He may appear to be a naïve and helpless child aimlessly wandering around space, but his quest is concerned with the most fundamental question of all – what is life for? A special little boy with an infectious mop of golden hair. Author: William Boyd Somewhat purposefully Logan Mountstuart is presented as a half-remembered man of letters in Any Human Heart . But the vibrant Mountstuart is one of the most interesting characters in modern literature – an intellectual constantly making a mess of things; a doomed romantic; a curious spectator at many of the most significant events of the 20th century. A man, above all, who you’d like to share a beer, or four, with. Author: Harper Lee Atticus Finch might not exemplify the most obvious characteristics of cool: he’s not reciting freeform poetry to impress women at 4am, but the detail is everything. Bold, heroic, noble, honourable… Atticus Finch is a vision of idealised masculinity. He is a true role model in every sense of the word, and if that isn’t cool then we might as well all give up and go home. Author: John Fante John Fante is one of the unsung heroes of 20th century American literature. His unflinching prose and depictions of social realism found its greatest character in Arturo Bandini. In essence, Bandini was Fante – a struggling writer, unapologetically embracing life with a vigour that may have bordered on the reckless, but was nonetheless captivating. Bandini was the protagonist in four Fante novels – Ask The Dust being the most notorious, but Wait Until Spring, Bandini , the first. Author: William Shakespeare Sir John Falstaff is the archetypal rogue – a larger than life cad that could eat, drink and make merry for England. And in three Shakespeare plays that’s exactly what he does. He gets Prince Hal into all manner of colourful scrapes. Everyone knows a similar riotously funny scoundrel, and that’s why Falstaff has endured in the affectation of Shakespeare acolytes down the years. Author: George Pelecanos Pelecanos might be better known for his involvement with The Wire , but it’s his hard-boiled crime novels that purists return to. The mesmeric Dimitri Karras is first introduced in King Suckerma n, the second book in his DC Quartet, and he quickly becomes the pivotal figure in Pelecanos’s vivid world. From glorious youth to the lessons hard learned by middle age, Karras, and his buddy Marcus Clay, leap from the page again and again. Author: Michael Chabon In 1939, Joe Kavalier, a Jewish 19-year-old budding artist and magic/escapologist nut flees Nazi-occupied Prague and goes to live with his cousin Sam Clay. Kavalier is typically taciturn, but cool. A dashing and heroic young man obsessed with saving his family, he pours his creative efforts into bashing the Nazis, while romancing the novel’s beautiful and captivating heroine. Think of Kavalier as equal parts Atticus Finch and mythical Superman. Author: Mark Twain Long before Jack Kerouac and his beat buddies went traversing America in search of life, kicks and fast times, Huckleberry Finn was having his own unforgettable adventures up and down the Mississippi. A wonderfully observed figure full of childlike charm and wonder, Huckleberry Finn is one of the totemic figures in literature. His pursuit of freedom and his dealings with race and racism make him one of the coolest kids ever. Author: Don Winslow Vietnam vet and DEA agent Art Keller is like a dog with a bone. An obsessive individual who over the course – a full 29 years - of Don Winslow’s tour-de-force exploration of America’s helpless ‘war on drugs’, refuses to bow down in the face of seemingly unbeatable odds. Rather than a bland hero, Keller is flawed; his determination is admirable, but despite his cunning, his unflinching masculinity and righteousness, will he lose everything? Author: Jack Kerouac Dean Moriarty was the personification of the beat generation – a charismatic individual whose values and beliefs signalled a clear break with traditional America. The real Moriarty – Neal Cassady – might have been a Byron-esque character , but on the page he simply evoked an era of unfettered cool. Author: Irvine Welsh Let’s get one thing straight: heroin isn’t cool. But Mark Renton, Irvine Welsh’s anti-hero, is. His friends might be doomed, but ultra-cynical Rents is somehow going to rise above this malaise. Maybe after his next hit, mind. His cultural tastes – especially on the subject of music – are well worth mirroring. Choose life; choose Rents. Author: Truman Capote Holly Golightly is an American icon – although that might have more to do with Audrey Hepburn’s sublime portrayal of her in the cinematic adaptation, than Capote’s original novella. Hepburn gave Golightly an air of chic elegance; in reality, Holly is much more troubled. However, her life – or the facade – is one long glamorous swirl of parties and living the Manhattan high life. Holly Golightly will always stand as a byword for metropolitan cool. Author: Roald Dahl Man’s primal instinct is survival – well, that equally applies to foxes. Mr Fox displays all the traits associated with his vulpine tribe – cunning and trickery chief among them – and he regularly has need to call on them in order to outsmart the farmers who wish to do him and his family harm. Of course, this being a Roald Dahl novel, there is only winner. That Mr Fox sports a natty line in threads – especially his tweed suits – only elevates him in the pantheon of cool. Author: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The greatest – and coolest – detective of all time. Erudite, witty, charming… Holmes set the benchmark against which all other fictional detectives are measured. Across four novels and 56 short stories, Holmes used all his powers of logic and persuasion to crack each case. And at the end of the day he used to relax with artificial stimulants – when cocaine was legal of course. Author: George Orwell Another non-human; another cooler-than-thou radical. Snowball, a thinly disguised Leon Trotsky, is the good pig – to Napoleon’s Stalin – in George Orwell’s evergreen revolutionary allegory. Snowball was caring, deeply philosophical and was optimistic about the success of the revolution. That he was ostracised by the cynical Napoleon does not lessen our admiration for him. Author: Raymond Chandler They don’t write men like they used to. Today, men have feelings, which is all well and good, but way back when – let’s say the late Thirties through to the early Fifties – men wore suits, sported fedoras, drank whiskey or brandy, cracked wise and got the job done. This no-nonsense approach is beautifully exemplified by hard-boiled private eye Philip Marlowe, who was stunningly successful with the dames too. Simpler times, folks, simpler times. Author: John Niven Now, much like we’re not condoning the use of smack , we’re not encouraging murder as a legitimate method of getting on in life. Actually we’re not encouraging murder full stop. However, even though contemptuous A&R man Steven Stelfox is utterly obscene; has no redeeming qualities, and regularly dispatches of bodies with nary a trace of guilt, there’s something venerable about his drive. Think of him as a Patrick Bateman for our deeply distrustful times. Author: Miguel de Cervantes Don Quixote is routinely heralded as one of the greatest literary creations of all time. A member of the Spanish nobility who wants to embark on a noble quest to revive the dormant chivalric tradition, Don Quixote is a cool customer. Alongside his partner Sancho Panza, he traverses Spain and stumbles upon all manner of comic situations as he seeks to discover, well, who knows what? Some have speculated he wants to destroy injustice. Others say the meaning is infinite. That’s pretty cool in our book. Author: Laurence Sterne Confusing, impenetrable, enigmatic, Tristram Shandy is one of literature’s most perplexing characters. He is also one of the coolest. As the title suggests, the novel contains Shandy’s wildly diverging and unmediated thoughts regurgitated onto the page in one long rebel yell. Embellishments and lies scatter the prose, as does plagiarism. Shandy is post-modern even before the era of the modern. Nice. Author: J. D. Salinger While Holden Caulfield may typify everything that folk over the age of 30 find distasteful about youth – narcissism, angst, misguided rebellion… - it would be perverse not to include him here. Caulfield finds the world around him dispiriting and superficial; his alienation is laid bare in the clearest terms. Just because most of us compromise upon adulthood, doesn’t mean we are right. Caulfield’s supposed immaturity is actually a sign of his maturity. He’s got the world figured. Author: Charles Dickens Whether the Artful Dodger was a petty criminal by circumstance or temperament needn’t concern us. The clue to Jack Dawkins’ hip credentials is provided by the adjective in his title. His pickpocketing skills are adroit and dexterous, and he uses his manifold wits to survive his harsh times. Deep beneath his streetwise exterior beats the heart of an impassioned and friendly young boy. Author: Douglas Coupland To be fresh out of adolescence in the early Nineties was a disorientating experience. The assumptions of the preceding baby boomer generation had been torn asunder. Into this void entered a generation of hyper intelligent, yet confused individuals. Andy Palmer is the ultimate evocation of this rootless life. His tales of working his McJob while trying to make sense of a new world order defined a very cool, but cautious, coterie of people. Author: Franz Kafka Of all the characters here, Joseph K is easily the most mysterious. A kind of bourgeois everyman, he is arrested for an unspecified crime. At first, he tries to discover why he has been arrested, but in time he becomes resigned to his fate. His cool detachment from the events that guide him inexorably towards his death are fantastic to behold. Author: Steig Larsson Do not mess with Lisbeth Salander. Complete with a litany of thoroughly modern ailments and qualities , Salander is not to be messed with – although many have tried. Larsson speculated that Salander was what Pippi Longstocking might have been like when she grew up. Author: Ken Kesey R. P. McMurphy is a rebel with a cause. His decision to declare insanity in order to serve the rest of his prison sentence in comparative peace might be misguided, but once ensconced in a mental institution he shines like a beacon, especially in relation to the tyrannical Nurse Ratched. His efforts to coax life out of his fellow inmates are appreciated, thus confirming his heroic status. Author: Charles Bukowski Bums, punks and outsiders might make for unlikely role models, but in the world of cool, straight society is shunned. Henry Chinaski is one such animated outcast. Like Fante’s Arturo Bandini, Chinaski is the alter ego of Bukowski, and his colourful tales of hi jinks, gambling, womanising and boozing are effectively a panacea to any troubled by beige mediocrity. We might not want to be him, but we’re grateful he’s out there causing trouble at every turn. Author: Lewis Carroll Not many characters are recognisable by their first name alone – Alice is a notable exception. A young girl whose inquisitive nature holds a mirror up to the often complacent and acquiescent adult world, Alice is swept away by the magical world of Wonderland. The nonsensical world is where she can finally feel at home. A timeless reminder of the power of the imagination. Author: Fyodor Dostoyevsky Raskolnikov is a complex young chap, who believes he belongs to a camp of extraordinary humans who are not beholden to a society’s laws, values and traditions. His hubris – he thinks of himself as a latter day radical Robin Hood - is only matched by his penury, and this uncomfortable combination is charted in Dostoyevsky’s acclaimed work. Author: William Makepeace Thackeray Whether intentional or not, Becky Sharp acts as a lacerating dagger at the heart of the British establishment. Her ambitious and overbearing manner might not be the quintessence of womanhood – especially as drawn by upper class society – but she recognises the abundant flaws in the human condition and seeks to highlight them mercilessly. A beautiful, clever, sometimes deceitful, but all-too-real literary creation. Author: Jonathan Franzen Richard Katz’s life reads like a roll call of cool – boho intellectual, rakish, womaniser, hedonist, musician in a renowned new wave band… And then just when he finds some sort of fulfilment, he finds creative success in early middle age with his alt. country outfit Walnut Surprise. Katz proves cool is an evolving state of mind and not just currency for the young. Succour for all who will never see 30 – let alone 40 – again. Author: Cormac McCarthy Cool is too often associated with the nefarious activities of nattily dressed kids running amok in a neon-clad metropolis. What’s really cool is protecting your son in a post-apocalyptic landscape, while recognising that you are dying. Cormac McCarthy’s tribute to fatherhood is a vividly drawn, unnamed man that loves his son more than life itself. A poignant and unforgettable character. Author: Oscar Wilde Wotton is the archetypal Victorian aesthete and dandy. A man for who lavish extravagance, art and beauty are the only interesting things in life. A notorious hedonist, coruscating wit and delightful raconteur, he is what Dorian Gray aspires to be. Wotton is emblematic of his colourful times, but, moreover, a lively voice who will always be slightly askew of bland societal norms. Author: Gabriel Garcia Marquez The second son of José Arcadio Buendía – the founding father of Macondo - Colonel Aureliano is a complex character, combining brutality during the wars with moments of beatific artistic endeavour. His infectious, yet multifaceted nature is further highlighted by his voracious sexual behaviour: he fathers 17 sons and calls each one of them Aureliano. Like George Foreman. Author: Haruki Murakami Fun, spirited, outgoing, smart, sexy… Midori is just what the protagonist of Murakami’s greatest novel, Toru Watanabe, needs after his doomed relationship with the former girlfriend of his best friend who killed himself. See? Midori is the personification of Sixties idealism, and is clearly embracing the changing times, while seeking to retain the positive aspects of traditional values. Author: Stephen King A gunslingin’ renegade is obviously going to be irredeemably cool. And so it is with Roland Deschain. Arguably Stephen King’s greatest creation, Deschain is cut from the rugged rock that gives forth strong, silent types. A disciplined, no-nonsense anti-hero, he has suffered great injustice and misery in his life, thus making his principled and dignified dedication to his quest even more admirable. Author: Bret Easton Ellis Only the rich and glamorous can be professionally jaded by the age of 18. Clay is an unfeeling and cynical hedonist who uses people – men and women – much like he uses a toothbrush: for their functionality. His life is one big vivid and evocative swirl, but he’s had enough of the hipster life. Cool as vicarious evil thrills. Author: John Kennedy Toole Quite possibly the funniest character in modern literature, the larger than life Ignatius J. Reilly deplores the modern world and its pop culture leanings. He dresses in a hunting cap, flannel shirt, baggy pants and scarf, and spends the entire novel criticising everyone and everything around him. He would no doubt despise the thought of being considered cool. Such disregard to these conventions makes him, inadvertently, very cool. Author: Nick McDonell Drug dealers don’t tend to be thoughtful 17-year-old philosophers, but that’s the fate – ahem – dealt to White Mike. A boy who detests mind-altering substances – he even abstains from booze – he inhabits the vacuous upper class world of partying adolescents in Manhattan. Never seen in anything but an overcoat and jeans, his mysterious presence makes him an alienated hero for disaffected teens. Author: Ian Fleming It’s easy to forget that 007 began life in literature, rather than the big screen. But it was Bond’s origins in the books of Ian Fleming – and not so secretly based on Fleming’s work in the world of espionage – that first caused an ultra-cool fuss. Bond is a cold, detached secret agent with expensive tastes – a worldly, well-bred individual who can floor men and women with equal style and minimum of fuss.

"Log in using your social network account Log in directly with The Independent Try Independent Minds free for 1 month Hi } William Brown Chosen by Barbara Trapido William is a child rebel in stifling suburbia. His instincts are against social climbing, pseudo-intellectualism and the humdrum. He has a flair for befriending eccentric outcasts, while cutting a swathe through village fêtes. From 15p €0. 18 $0. 18 USD 0. 27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras. Flashman Chosen by Terry Pratchett Harry Flashman, that fictional reprobate - wenching and dodging his way through the major military engagements of the 19th century - is funnier, more honest and certainly less harmful than many of the real brave fools whose paths he double-crosses. You just can't help liking the amiable cad. Pip Chosen by Tim Lott Philip Pirrip , of Great Expectations , gripped me at the earliest age. Like him, I had hopes of escaping the loving, but limited, quotidian world that surrounded me. And, like Pip, I learnt to be ashamed of those good people that I loved and then bitterly ashamed of that shame. Joe Gargery Chosen by Maeve Binchy Joe Gargery in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations is so decent and so real that you always think you know him. Eager and ambitious for the poisonous Pip, Joe is humble and self-effacing. He makes me cry. Miss Havisham Chosen by John Burnside There's nothing more attractive in a character than unshakeable obsession. I love Great Expectations ' Miss Havisham because she won't remove that wedding dress, even as she recognises the random nature of her revenge. I was inconsolable when she vanishes into the flames. Tintin Chosen by Philip Pullman I like Tintin's blandness, his blankness, his lack of depth; he is an empty page on which adventures can be drawn. He is clearly a friendly and honourable chap; his dog is loyal, his friends dependably amusing, his way of life both comfortable and interesting. Elizabeth Bennett Chosen by Donna Leon . My favourite is Elizabeth Bennett, from Pride and Prejudice . Just put Lizzie next to Fanny Price : Fanny will drone on about virtue; Lizzie will tell a joke. Fanny will praise the long sermons of her cousin, Edmund; Lizzie will make a provocative remark to Mr Darcy. Fanny will disapprove; Lizzie will laugh out loud. Rupert Campbell-Black Chosen by Tilly Bagshawe I spent most of my teens wishing Rupert would stride into my parents' kitchen in dirty hunting boots and whisk me away. He's sexy, but with a little-boy vulnerability that makes you forgive him anything. Anna Howe Chosen by Matt Thorne Even though Anna Howe doesn't always give the best advice, she takes an extraordinary interest in her friend's romantic life. I would love to have a friend who wrote such interesting letters. Josef K Chosen by James Hawes In The Trial , Kafka's master-trap is to make us accept that Josef K's point of view is objective, narrative fact. In fact, Josef K is no timeless Everyman but a specific satirical character: a thoroughly modern salaryman with a goal-oriented, easy-to-clean mental world who is obsessed with office power-plays and visits a prostitute once a week. Julien Sorel Chosen by the anonymous author of Belle de Jour Julien Sorel in Stendhal's The Red and the Black is clever, dashing, successful and completely amoral. But he's also a romantic. This proves to be his downfall, and anyone who believes the rubbish about which respective planets men and women are from has only to read his final thoughts to be disabused of that notion. Sherlock Holmes Chosen by AN Wilson Sherlock Holmes is a deductive genius, using his analytic mind for the good. His druggie life is both gloriously detached and also more deeply engaged with the crime-ridden, class-divided, evil world of late-Victorian London. Gandalf Chosen by Mary Hoffman JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings boasts the best white wizard in fiction - not morally ambiguous or neutral like Merlin, but not infallible either. Always wise when present and strangely comforting even when predicting doom and destruction. Emma Chosen by Diana Wynne Jones Jane Austen's Emma is so very human. She is always plunging into such embarrassing mistakes - and yet they're the mistakes one longs to make oneself, like telling the tediously garrulous Miss Bates to shut up. And, bless her, she is truly ashamed when she does, because she is actually very nice. Nicer than I am by a long way. The Elephant's Child Chosen by Michael Morpurgo The Just So Stories by Rudyard Kipling taught me to love the music in words. But what made me want to listen to the music was the feisty Elephant's Child, who, with his newly acquired trunk, has such sweet revenge on all his chastising relatives. Nigel Molesworth Chosen by Joanne Harris The literary hero who has remained most dear to me is Geoffrey Willans's schoolboy, Nigel Molesworth - a fearless critic, a comedian, a subversive, a philosopher who discusses Camus on the football pitch and whose trenchant powers of social commentary are, as any fule kno, enhanced by his appalling spelling. Sir Lancelot Chosen by Wendy Holden My favourite character - and the sexiest man in literature - is Sir Lancelot in Tennyson's "" The Lady of Shalott"" He is drawn with hilariously euphemistic zest - all that stuff about his silver bugle and blazened baldric, and his helmet with its plume. It's barely decent, frankly, and it puts a smile on my face every time I read it. Philip Marlowe Chosen by Michael Connelly Philip Marlowe, the private detective created by Raymond Chandler, is the most inspirational and influential character I have ever met. He chimed with all my fantasies of heroism and toughness and loneliness. Mrs Chippy Chosen by Lynne Truss Mrs Chippy, from Mrs Chippy's Last Expedition by Caroline Alexander, is a character based on the real-life cat that went on the Endurance with Shackleton. The narrator of the book, she's engaging and - typically for a cat - regards herself as an important member of the expedition. She was the only casualty of the expedition and the book ends when they are about to shoot her because they couldn't take her across the ice. Mrs Norris Chosen by Sally Beauman Mrs Norris in the glittering satire Mansfield Park , is Austen's most profound, subtle portrait of the banality of evil. Madame Bovary Chosen by David Mitchell I can't pick just one, but at the Fictional People Awards Ceremony I hope they put me on a table with Mikhail Bulgakov's Devil and Robert Bolt's Thomas More, for their erudition and conversation. The Cheshire Cat would be welcome for his humour and his knack with practical metaphysics. Finally, Madame Bovary should fumble her way to our table, flushed-looking and late, to dish some dirt on the judges. Harriet M Welsch Chosen by Tracy Chevalier Harriet M Welsch, in Harriet the Spy by Louise Fitzhugh, is a precocious 11-year-old New Yorker who is obsessed with spying. Her friends ostracise her for writing brutally honest things about them. Harriet is curious, truthful, and a loner - all qualities a writer needs. Toad Chosen by Julia Donaldson My favourite literary character is a toad, the comically cantankerous half of Arnold Lobel's amphibian duo, Frog and Toad . I love him because he embodies so many human foibles, such as laziness, fear, and attachment to routine. Kari Buhl Chosen by Colin Wilson The character I most admire is the hero of Hugo van Hofmannsthal's social comedy The Difficult Man . Kari Buhl is an aristocrat who embodies his creator's ideal of decency, modesty, intelligence, and immense sensitivity to the feelings of others. Oskar Schell Chosen by Louisa Young . Today's favourite literary character is Oskar Schell, aged 10, hero of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close , by Jonathan Safran Foer. Tolstoy's judge Chosen by Dan Jacobson My favourite fictional character is a judge who appears on just a few pages of Leo Tolstoy's Resurrection . Awaiting him in the dock is the desperate Katya, a prostitute, whom he is about to send to her death by forced labour. He has other things on his mind, however. Will he learn from his doctor, later that day, that he has cancer? Daniel Deronda Chosen by Maggie O'Farrell In a literary family tree, George Eliot's Daniel Deronda would be a cousin of another of my favourite characters, Hamlet. They are both intelligent, brooding, fatherless young men at odds with the world. Antonia Shimerdas Chosen by Elizabeth Noble Antonia Shimerdas, the eponymous heroine of Willa Cather's My Antonia , isn't coquettish or witty like some other heroines I admire. It is her stoicism and determination that make me love her. Humbert Humbert Chosen by Andrew Miller There's no funnier monster in modern literature than poor, doomed Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita . Going to hell in his company would always be worth the ride. Muskrat Chosen by Michelle Paver My favourite? The Muskrat from the Moomin books by Tove Jansson for his severity and his soaring ambition to be an ascetic, which is so often thwarted by real life. Funny, endearing and true. Anne of Green Gables Chosen by Lennie Goodings The feisty, funny and above all unabashedly passionate Anne of Green Gables, by LM Montgomery. She is a red-haired, freckle-faced orphan who faces the world with absolutely nothing but the sheer force of her personality. I love her. Tom Ripley Chosen by Sarah Waters Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr Ripley is a wonderful literary creation. I don't think I'd get much sleep if I spent the night at his house. Highsmith manages to make him so sympathetic, even while she's coolly detailing the eerie processes that lead him into murder. And he gets away with it. Patrick Bateman Chosen by Rob Grant The monstrous creation of Bret Easton Ellis's dark, dark satire American Psycho is - uniquely among fictional serial killers - a physical coward. He's reduced to pleading wretchedness by a taxi driver who mugs him. His true wickedness lies more in his opinions than in his deeds. Lyra Chosen by Gill Coleridge Lyra Silvertongue from Philip Pullman's superb His Dark Materials trilogy is feisty, determined, brave and never compromises - a remarkable and endearing person. Joachim Ziemssen Chosen by Philip Hensher Joachim Ziemssen in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain is a soldier who never boasts, who wants to be heroic in battle and has to be heroic in the sickroom. He's not witty or charming, just honest and virtuous. Hans Castorp Chosen by Dr Chris Fletcher, Hans Castorp, the central character in The Magic Mountain , is introduced as "" a perfectly ordinary, if engaging young man"" By the end of the novel, he has, through "" adventures in the flesh and spirit"" fallen in love with life. He remains ordinary, but we still cry for him. The Cat in The Hat Chosen by Peter Florence Morgan le Fay is my dream girl, Odysseus my hero guy, but the character I've really loved is Dr Seuss's the Cat in The Hat: a total anarchist getting away with it. Torturing the sanctimonious fish appealed, too. Oskar Matzerath Chosen by DBC Pierre "" Granted: I am an inmate of a mental hospital. This great first line of Günther Grass's The Tin Drum introduces my favourite character, Oskar Matzerath - a child, seemingly conscious from birth, who decides he doesn't want to deal with the adult world. Is that not a perfectly sensible response to urban family life? George Bowling Chosen by Neill Denny George Bowling, the fat insurance salesman who narrates George Orwell's Coming Up For Air , is cynical, funny, prejudiced, angry and honest. Unlike most literary characters, you could imagine sharing a pint with him. Godwin Peak Chosen by DJ Taylor Godwin Peak in George Gissing's Born in Exile is a humbly-born scientist and ferocious free-thinker. Avid to marry a "" lady"" he falls in love with the well-bred Sidwell Warricombe. To assist his case, he pretends to be a clergyman. Elinor Dashwood Chosen by Sarah Smyth Elinor, in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility , is one of those people who have a kind of undemonstrative integrity that leads them instinctively always to do the right thing. She's considerate without being patronising, witty without being sarcastic, and intelligent but not supercilious. Tom Jones Chosen by Philippa Gregory In Henry Fielding's novel, Tom is a foundling, discovered on a doorstep, falls in love with the beautiful Sophia and is robustly unfaithful only after much temptation. He turns out to be well-born, and marries the girl. Fermin Chosen by Scott Pack The most memorable fictional characters are the walk-on parts. My favourite is Fermin, the silver-tongued tramp with the dark past from Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow Of The Wind . A true gentleman. Molly Bloom Chosen by Edward Rutherfurd Molly Bloom, Leopold's wife in James Joyce's Ulysses . What is wonderful is the way she describes her life, her affair and her love for her husband in terms of all five senses. Zazie Chosen by Dan Rhodes Zazie, the foul-mouthed pubescent star of Raymond Queneau's breakneck Parisian romp Zazie in the Metro , doesn't just leap off the page, she also kicks you in the shins and loudly accuses you of a sex offence. Michael Henchard Chosen by John Walsh Michael Henchard in The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy. It's the most tragic tale of a man who did a great wrong and pays for it later. The way Henchard arranges his life just so, only to see it wrecked and ruined by Fate - it makes me howl with pathos. Pechorin Chosen by Hari Kunzru When I was a teenager I had a thing for Pechorin, the central character of Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time . He is still my "" favourite"" though I haven't thought about him for a long time. He's probably first-equal with Max from Where the Wild Things Are , and the Cat in the Hat. Flora Poste Chosen by Lesley Pearse Every character in Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm is a delight, but I identify most with bossy, nosy Flora. I love her need for order. She's never a bully, just a person who is utterly convinced that her way is best. George Chosen by Jenni Murray Enid Blyton's Famous Fiver was the only character who seemed to feel the way I did about adventure, being "" one of the lads"" and the dullness of domestic duties. Fagin Chosen by Josephine Cox A twisted, misshapen figure of a man, one minute he's terrifying and the next he's gentle as a lamb. When he's imprisoned at the end, your heart goes out to him. Alexander Portnoy Chosen by Jonny Geller Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint is tragic, hilarious and plain embarrassing. When I first read it , I felt guilty for having enjoyed it so much - was my mum watching me read it? When I read it next , I found it incredibly moving. At 34, when I read it last, Portnoy became this unashamedly honest Jewish American voice howling at history. Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky Chosen by Gillian Slovo Anna Karenina 's Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky is a hopeless philanderer and useless bureaucrat. He has the kindest of hearts but he's also aimless, dumb and pleasure-seeking. Tolstoy's genius is to paint this unblinking portrait, which, rather than alienating, ends up seducing the reader. Uncle Matthew Chosen by Kathleen Tessaro Uncle Matthew, from Nancy Mitford's The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate , is a work of comic genius and a delight. Bathsheba Everdene Chosen by Di Speirs Vital, passionate, spirited - from the moment Bathsheba appears in Far From the Madding Crowd , she is beguiling. You can denounce her faults - she's selfish and capricious - but it's hard not to admire her determined independence. Kim Chosen by Jamila Gavin Rudyard Kipling describes his hero as an "" imp, and that's what makes him one of my most favourite characters. I admire his cheerful arrogance and independence. Horatia Winwood Chosen by Jane Morpeth Georgette Heyer's Horatia Winwood, for her stammer, her dark frowning brows, her impetuous nature and her prodigious shopping habit. Dr Watson Chosen by Judith Kerr There is something appealing about a man who stows his stethoscope under his top hat. Modest to a degree, Watson does not bother us with facts about himself, since Sherlock Holmes is so much more important. His only irritating habit is the way he refers to some of Holmes's cases without telling us the full story. God Chosen by Michael Marshall Polymorphic, unpredictable, unaccountable; omnipotent yet negligent, kind yet vicious. Suitable to any genre or period. Able to hold centre stage in plot, or work subtly in deep background. Never requires a deus ex machina. A character you can immerse yourself in, forever. Rupert Psmith Chosen by Philip Downer Psmith demonstrates a degree of youthful flexibility that PG Wodehouse's Jeeves/ Wooster and Blandings characters couldn't quite muster, creating the most demanding and dangerous situations, simply for the pleasure he derives from extricating himself from them. Essentially, you want to be Psmith: he doesn't care what he says; he gets the money; and he gets the girl. Dick Diver Chosen by Geoff Dyer In spite of all the distracting temptations offered to Dick Diver in F Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night - happiness, success, wealth, glamour, the admiration of others - he realizes that he will only come into his own by becoming a charmless bore, an alcoholic, a lonely failure. What willpower! Benjamin Trotter Chosen by Julie Myerson I am in love with Benjamin Trotter in Jonathan Coe's The Rotter's Club . My Midlands upbringing was almost identical, and I can relate to so many aspects of him. Coe depicts, with heartshaking honesty, that fragile teenage combination of prig and dreamer - the sense of being at the absolute heroic centre of your own life. Hannibal Lecter Chosen by Pauline McLynn Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter has exquisite taste, is well read, surrounds himself with utter beauty and is the meanest killing machine on the face of the literary earth. I wouldn't mind him eating my kidneys as long as he fed me an excellent bottle of red wine beforehand. Harry Angstrom Chosen by John Sutherland Harry Angstrom, the serial hero of John Updike's Rabbit tetralogy, is the only protagonist I've grown old with - doomed, but indomitable and lovable. Lorelei Chosen by Plum Sykes Anita Loos's Gentlemen Prefer Blondes takes the form of Lorelei's diary, which is full of her attempts to snag a rich man. She thinks she's an intellectual, but she's actually a dumb blonde. She's also one of the most ironic, endearing, hilarious, charming characters ever. Maisie Chosen by Candida Clark Henry James wrote What Maisie Knew soon after his play, Guy Domville , flopped in the West End in 1895. Where a lesser writer might have cracked, he delivered an incorruptible girl of five, triumphant in her "" undestroyed freshness"" Her victory is James's own. Bertie Wooster Chosen by Marian Keyes Bertie lives life to the full and knows how to enjoy himself. Wodehouse's hero is a wonderful example to anyone who takes it all a bit too seriously. Anne Elliot Chosen by Toby Litt Anne Elliot is the heroine of Jane Austen's last completed novel, Persuasion . She is wise, gentle, patient and oppressed by circumstance. Earlier in life, she was persuaded not to make an unwise match with a young sailor. When the book begins, she has had almost 10 years to regret her decision, yet she is not bitter. Haroun Chosen by Catherine Lockerbie, There are few such fabulous sons in fiction as Haroun in Salman Rushdie's anti-censorship fairy story, Haroun and The Sea of Stories . Haroun has everything: a silenced storytelling father to save, encounters with water genies and talking hoopoes, and a heroic role in one of the most luminous and resonant tales yet written in praise of freedom of the imagination. Jane Eyre Chosen by China Miéville Charlotte Brontë's heroine towers over those around her, morally, intellectually and aesthetically; she's completely admirable and compelling. Never camp, despite her Gothic surrounds, she takes a scalpel to the skin of the every day. Paddington Bear Chosen by Liz Thomson At forty-something, I still believe even the grizzliest grizzly wears a duffle coat and squashy hat and enjoys a marmalade sandwich. Today he'd be repatriated as an asylum-seeker, but I've no doubt Paddington's done much to help the cause of his real-life ursine relatives. Jim Dixon Chosen by Sue Townsend Jim Dixon, a lecturer at a provincial university and the anti-hero of Kingsley Amis's comic masterpiece Lucky Jim , is plagued his inability to take academic life seriously. He signalled the end of automatic deference to our superiors. Margaret Schlegel Chosen by Cynthia Ozick If "" favourite"" is meant to summon the daringly and dramatically admirable, then it must be Margaret Schlegel of EM Forster's Howards End . Practicality saves her from wasteful sentimentality, and imagination saves her from cynicism. Sally Jay Gorce Chosen by Alexandra Pringle, Elaine Dundy's The Dud Avocado and Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's were both published in 1958, and perhaps there was something about post-war, pre-Sixties bohemia that produced two of the most appealing heroines ever. For me, Sally Jay is just that bit tougher, funnier and more mordant than Holly Golightly. Madame Bovary Chosen by Francine Stock I first read Madame Bovary at 18 and loathed her. I have since come to admire Flaubert's masterwork of romantic delusion - and to recognise her faults as mine. John Self Chosen by Rachel Cugnoni, I remember reading Martin Amis's Money when I was about 18 and loving the thrillingly savage character of John Self. He was the ultimate bad boy when my real life was filled with good boys. Mike Chosen by Richard Beswick, "" The Day we Got Drunk on Cake"" is a beautiful, poignant story by William Trevor. It follows the course of a rackety afternoon in Soho in which a young man, Mike, goes on a pub crawl with a boring lush, gets increasingly drunk and makes nuisance calls to a girl he's in love with. Every time I read it I ache with nostalgia. Horatius Chosen by Jilly Cooper Macaulay's Horatius, the saviour of Rome, fought off a vast invading Tuscan army, until his companions behind him had hacked down the bridge to the city. His retreat cut off, heplunged into the River Tiber. As he swam to safety, even the Tuscans cheered. Leopold Bloom Chosen by David Lodge Leopold Bloom, the hero of Joyce's Ulysses , is a character in whom most of us can recognise universal human traits, follies, desires and fears. Through his creator's stream-of-consciousness we get to know him more intimately than perhaps any other fictional character before or since. Louisa Pollit Chosen by Amanda Craig Louisa Pollit in Christina Stead's The Man Who Loved Children is plain, passionate, brilliant and doomed, and a rare self-portrait of an artist as a young woman. You hate, pity and admire her all at once. Rhett Butler Chosen by Penny Vincenzi It's been a lifelong love affair between me and Gone With the Wind 's Rhett Butler. He seems to encapsulate every desirable male quality - sophistication, wit, courage and tenderness, too. Hamlet Chosen by Howard Jacobson For the charm of his intelligence, the quickness of his wit, the brilliance of his mimicry, the fastidiousness of his temperament, the soundness of his judgement, the excellence of his literary criticism, for his loathing of the world's opinion. The Swede Chosen by Nicholas Pearson, It has to be the Swede in Philip Roth's American Pastoral . The slow dismantling of his veneers, the ferocious way in which Roth chases to the truth of him, the terrified father, is devastating. Ebenezer le Page Chosen by Lisa Jewell Ebeneezer, the grizzled old Guernsey narrator of GB Edwards's The Book of Ebenezer le Page , who talks us through 70 years of comings and goings on the tiny island he never leaves in salty, stream-of-consciousness patois. Becky Sharp Chosen by Maggie Gee Witty, sexy, sandy-haired Becky Sharp, whose impoverished background explains her hunger for rich men and high position. She is a rebel from the very first chapter of Thackeray's Vanity Fair . Her one final act of kindness derives from her constant virtue: seeing things as they are. Arturo Chosen by Tim Parks My favourite boy hero is definitely Elsa Morante's Arturo, from Arturo's Island . Unaware that his father is criminally misogynist, Arturo grows up in almost total abandon on a tiny Mediterranean island in the company of his dog and a library of books chosen for their exclusion of women. His adolescence is painful and hilarious. Baron de Charlus Chosen by Hanif Kureishi I read Proust's Remembrance of Things Past when I was on the dole. De Charlus is a hilarious character who leads a kind of double life: he's a grand man in French society, but also a homosexual with a penchant for kitchen boys. Whenever he pops up in the book it cheers you up because you know that something witty is going to happen. Vicomte de Valmont Chosen by Nicholas Blincoe The hero of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses is a man of action who might have appeared in a minor role in any swashbuckler. But in this sly sexual thriller he takes centre stage, like a priapic puppet caught in his strings. Zeno Cosini Chosen by Paul Bailey The unlikely hero of Italo Svevo's comic Confessions of Zeno always puts a foot wrong: he marries the only plain girl in a family of beauties; he plays the violin with an excruciating lack of skill; all his successes are accidental. To read about him is to keep beguiling company. . Vautrin, Jacques Collin, Trompe-la-Mort Chosen by AS Byatt Balzac's heroic villain with many names is one of the greatest - wicked, inventive, brave, grimly witty, passionate and full of new aspects as he reappears in various novels. He is a hero of his time. John Dyson Chosen by Martin Jarvis Dyson, in Michael Frayn's 1967 Fleet Street novel Towards the End of the Morning , is a hilarious creation. He runs a department in a daily newspaper and dreams of celebrity. Journalist as Everyman. Moll Flanders Chosen by Carole Welch For her zest, and the wit and courage with which she overcomes the hand life deals her, using fair means or foul - usually foul. It's remarkable that Daniel Defoe's heroine first made her appearance in 1722. Dirk Struan Chosen by Conn Iggulden Dirk Struan was a man of rigid morality and honour, yet one who could countenance the ruthless destruction of evil. James Clavell wrote a first-class alpha - the Tai-Pan . Mickey Sabbath Chosen by Linda Grant Every year or so I re-read Philip Roth's Sabbath's Theater to spend time with the appalling Mickey Sabbath, the repulsive puppeteer who turned down the opportunity to join Jim Henson and make Muppets. He's a lech, a hater, a thug, but at least he reminds you what it is to be alive. Yossarian Chosen by William Sutcliffe Can there be a more thrilling voice in fiction than Catch-22's Yossarian? From the first page, in which he malingers in hospital with 'a pain in his liver' you feel you want to spend more time with this guy. In Yossarian, Joseph Heller minted a counter-culture Everyman for the late 20th century Dunbar Chosen by Will Self In Catch-22 , Dunbar believes he can increase his lifespan by cultivating boredom because every hour he lives through in a state of tedium seems far, far longer than one in which he is interested. His subversive attitudes lead to him being 'disappeared' by the nebulous authorities Milo Chosen by Michael Rosen The portrayal of Catch-22 's Milo Minderbender is a wonderful evocation of the crooks and spivs who surround any army of occupation. He is distinctive for using the abnormality of war to make money Moby Dick Chosen by Robert Crais The great white whale himself. With no dialogue and damned little screen time, his presence powers a cast of unforgettable characters across a canvas as deep and wide as the sea, and has kept their quest alive in our dreams across the generations Billy Bunter Chosen by Ian McMillan Frank Richards' Billy is a fat chap in glasses having adventures and being idiosyncratic. I love his optimism, waiting for the postal order that never comes; and his sticking a fat finger up at Mr Quelch. Bunter: the King! Bigwig Chosen by Glen David Gold When my students ask me about making strong characters, I always point them towards Richard Adams' Watership Down, as there are 15 major players whose personalities are vivid and distinct, and they're all rabbits. It has been 32 years since I first read the epic battle between General Woundwort and the awesome Bigwig, and I don't think I've ever again been so thrilled by a piece of literature James Bond Chosen by Ken Follet I read Casino Royale, when I was 12. It changed my life. Bond knew about all that intrigued me: cars, cocktails, guns, and ­ most of all ­ girls Send us your favourites! The best will be published in a forthcoming issue.

"By Lynn O’Connacht Lynn O’Connacht has an MA in English literature and creative writing, but wouldn’t call herself an authority on either. She’s been an English tutor, writer and editor for over a decade. She currently resides on the European continent and her idiom and spelling are, despite her best efforts, geographically confused, poor things. Her tastes are equally eclectic, though fantasy will always be her first love and most of her work contains at least one ace or arospec character. She has been chasing stories one way or another since she was old enough to follow a narrative. Read more about how this list was created By Claire Kann Let’s Talk About Love is a contemporary YA novel featuring a Black, biromantic asexual protagonist as she works out what she wants from life. Alice is easily the most relatable asexual character I’ve read to date. The first chapter of Let’s Talk About Love can be very rough for any asexual reader who’s ever been dumped because of their asexuality, but it soon settles into the fun and romantic romp that the reader is promised by the blurb. Let’s Talk About Love is open about using and exploring the split attraction model without ever trying to present Alice’s experiences as The One True Experience. It also includes several scenes with supportive and accepting authority figures. What Kann has managed to fit into less than 300 pages is absolutely stunning and nothing short of amazing. One of my favourite parts about Let’s Talk About Love is its explicit discussion of boundaries and its acknowledgement that Alice is allowed to set boundaries on how and whether she has sex in a romantic relationship. CW: Aphobia/Amisia in the first chapter. By R. J. Anderson Note: Quicksilver is a sequel/companion to Ultraviolet . While you can read Quicksilver on its own, it does contain massive spoilers for Ultraviolet . Quicksilver features one of my favourite ace coming out scenes in fiction. It’s a highly personal scene between Tori and Milo. It’s serious but light-hearted, acknowledging and avoiding many of the reactions that asexual readers may have encountered themselves in the past. The book actively tries to dismantle a lot of stereotypes regarding asexual people, such as the idea that asexual people are passionless or uncaring and actively seeking to avoid being part of a community. Tori is passionate and driven, with her motivations explicitly linked to her desire to make the world a better place and to contribute to her community. Quicksilver is one of the first books published to explicitly use the word ‘asexual’ and one of the first to actively and explicitly challenge the stereotypes that asexuals face in day-to-day life. At the time I compiled this list, it also remains one of the most successful books at countering these stereotypes and prejudices. CW: Aphobia/Amisia By Kathryn Ormsbee Tash Hearts Tolstoy can be a bit messy about its depiction of asexuality, I admit, but it’s messy in a way that will be very recognisable to asexual readers because it deals with the effects of internalised amisia. Tash is the writer and producer of a small amateur web series that becomes an overnight sensation. While she’s struggling to deal with the internet fame, she also has to deal with the changes within her family, the usual production problems, friendship problems and a romantic attraction in a long-distance relationship with another vlogger. In the midst of all this, Tash is left to figure out how to balance her life and becomes a lovely example of the way some asexuals are oblivious to innuendo or flirting, as she’s utterly oblivious to Paul’s feelings as well as her own. She’s incredibly passionate, not afraid of making mistakes or trying to fix them, and not always likeable. But she tries and is surrounded largely by supportive people. CW: Aphobia/Amisia By Alice Oseman Radio Silence is largely about the friendship between Frances and Aled, who meet by chance and start to make a hugely successful podcast together. Aled is explicitly demisexual and in a homoromantic relationship with Frances’ sort-of rival, Daniel. The demisexuality representation in Radio Silence is subtle yet effective and the romance in this novel takes a rare backseat to friendship. Filtered through Frances’ point of view, Radio Silence offers a rare glimpse at what being on the asexual spectrum looks and feels like to allosexuals in a way that doesn’t invalidate or stereotype the asexual character. Its strong focus on friendship is something that will appeal to many asexual and especially to aromantic readers looking for a book that acknowledges how powerful and important friendship is and that friendships are no less worthy than romantic relationships are. CW: suicide ideation, depression, emotional abuse, and animal cruelty. By Jo Walton While not YA fiction, The King’s Name is one of the best depictions of asexuality that I’ve had the pleasure of reading. The story follows Sulien ap Gwien as she joins the army of King Urdo. The King’s Name is deeply inspired by Arthurian legends and the world is rich and detailed. While the book never puts a name to Sulien’s sexuality, she’s explicitly shown to be an aromantic asexual person. The strength of the book’s depiction of asexuality lies in the easy acceptance that the book’s characters and society shows Sulien repeatedly. Though there are some jokes and innuendos made at Sulien’s expense, they’re never mean-spirited or nasty. The King’s Name is the only book I’ve ever read that has its society accept asexuality so casually. CW: Rape Note: This book does not appear in our database because it is adult fiction. However, it could certainly appeal to older teens, especially those interested in historical fantasy. By Lyssa Chiavari Fourth World features not one, but two asexual protagonists. Isaak and Nadin come from two different times and very different places, but they’ll have to work together in order to save both their worlds. Having multiple characters on the asexual spectrum allows Fourth World to explicitly include and explore different experiences. Isaak is demisexual and well aware of this. He’s also attracted to one of his best friends and is trying to work out how to tell her. Nadin is sex-repulsed and asexual and is trying to figure out her feelings and how to tell her fiancé what she wants. My favourite part is the way the book captures Nadin’s feelings when her partner kisses her and she discovers she doesn’t like it. It’s a visceral scene, neatly demonstrating how asexuals, sex-repulsed asexuals especially, can be made to feel broken by the way society looks at them. Isaak’s narrative also explicitly tackles some of the prejudices against demisexuality. CW: Aphobia/Amisia By Marieke Nijkamp Before I Let Go features a questioning asexual character as she tries to discover what caused her best friend’s death. Though Before I Let Go conflates asexuality and aromanticism, it’s a novel in which the asexual character is both questioning and allowed to simply be. Given how many people still believe that a character’s sexuality or gender identity should have a clear narrative point, Nijkamp’s decision to explicitly include Corey’s sexuality without tying it to the plot is a powerful one. Corey’s exploration of asexuality will resonate with readers who are still trying to figure out whether or where they fall on the spectrum. CW: Suicide, parental neglect, emotional abuse, attempted murder By Claudie Arseneault City of Strife features several asexual characters, all of them on different points of the spectrum. It’s an epic fantasy novel with an all-queer cast inspired by D&D and features Arseneault’s trademark combination of idealism and practicality, resulting in one of the most hopeful and accepting books I’ve had the pleasure of reading. City of Strife is the first book in a trilogy and its exploration of different orientations is deliciously diverse. Its asexual representation covers the spectrum and features casual discussions and acceptance of queer identities. The heart of the trilogy is Cal, an aromantic asexual priest with a heart of gold and a hug for anyone who needs one. Cal’s sexuality is immediately clear whereas other characters are clearly questioning. City of Strife is one of the few books I’ve read that shows that labels can change as we learn about ourselves and this doesn’t make someone any less of a person or that they’re broken or lying. CW: Abuse , violence, fire/burns, torture, racism, mind control.

"This post is part of our International Women’s Day celebration. See all the posts here . Some of the wisest people I know I met from children’s books, particularly from middle grade books . Ever since I could read, I have stored treasures of wisdom from so many amazing girls who stood up for themselves, overcame overwhelming challenges, made mistakes and made things right again, were wronged and extended grace, fell down and got back up, and stood by their convictions despite persecution. You can say that even now, everything I need to know about life I learned from the girls in middle grade books. Here are fifty of my absolute favorite heroines from middle grade books, why I love them, and some of my favorite quotes from the books. These kids unabashedly declare that girls are amazing and are forces to be reckoned with. If my own daughters read through this whole list, I will consider my work as a mom done! YOUNGER MIDDLE GRADE Mya Tibbs from The Magnificent Mya Tibbs, Spirit Week Showdown by Crystal Allen Anna Wang from The Year of the Book by Andrea Cheng In Chinese, peng you means friend. But in any language, all Anna knows for certain is that friendship is complicated. When Anna needs company, she turns to her books. Whether traveling through A Wrinkle in Time , or peering over My Side of the Mountain , books provide what real life cannot—constant companionship and insight into her changing world. Books, however, can’t tell Anna how to find a true friend. Why I love Anna : She’s a huge reader and reminds me a lot of what I was like as a child. I love how she embraces her own self over the course of the story. Ava Wren from Ava and Pip by Carol Weston Meet outgoing Ava Wren, a fun fifth grader who tries not to lose patience with her shy big sister. When Pip’s 13th birthday party turns into a disaster, Ava gets a story idea for a library contest. But uh-oh, Ava should never have written “Sting of the Queen Bee. ” Can Ava and her new friend help Pip come out of her shell? And can Ava get out of the mess she has made? Why I love Ava : She’s smart, she’s silly, and she’s a problem solver. I love her obsession with palindromes! Favorite Quote : “If you won’t be you…who will? ” Ruby from Ruby Goldberg’s Bright Idea by Anna Humphrey Ten-year-old Ruby Goldberg is determined to win her school science fair and beat her nemesis Dominic Robinson. She’s snagged second place for the last two years, and she’s set on claiming first prize. The only trouble is that Ruby has no ideas. When her grandfather’s beloved basset hound dies, Ruby thinks of the perfect thing that will cheer him up and win her first place—an innovative, state-of-the-art, not-to-be-duplicated Ruby Goldberg invention! Why I love Ruby : She’s full of ideas, always thinking of creative solutions to problems, and she loves her grandfather to bits. Theodora Tenpenny from Under the Egg by Laura Marx Fitzgerald When Theodora Tenpenny spills a bottle of rubbing alcohol on her late grandfather’s painting, she discovers what seems to be an old Renaissance masterpiece underneath. That’s great news for Theo, who’s struggling to hang onto her family’s two-hundred-year-old townhouse and support her unstable mother on her grandfather’s legacy of $463. There’s just one problem: Theo’s grandfather was a security guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and she worries the painting may be stolen. Why I love Theo : She has such affection for her home and neighborhood, and she’s an amazing problem solver when the building she lives in begins to fall apart. Manami from Paper Wishes by Lois Sepahban Ten-year-old Manami did not realize how peaceful her family’s life on Bainbridge Island was until the day it all changed. It’s 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Manami and her family are Japanese American, which means that the government says they must leave their home by the sea and join other Japanese Americans at a prison camp in the desert. Manami is sad to go, but even worse is that they are going to have to give her and her grandfather’s dog, Yujiin, to a neighbor to take care of. Manami decides to sneak Yujiin under her coat and gets as far as the mainland before she is caught and forced to abandon Yujiin. She and her grandfather are devastated, but Manami clings to the hope that somehow Yujiin will find his way to the camp and make her family whole again. It isn’t until she finds a way to let go of her guilt that Manami can reclaim the piece of herself that she left behind and accept all that has happened to her family. Why I love Manami : She’s extremely loyal and is true to herself and her family. Astrid from Roller Girl by Victoria Jamieson For most of her twelve years, Astrid has done everything with her best friend Nicole. But after Astrid falls in love with roller derby and signs up for derby camp, Nicole decides to go to dance camp instead. And so begins the most difficult summer of Astrid’s life as she struggles to keep up with the older girls at camp, hang on to the friend she feels slipping away, and cautiously embark on a new friendship. As the end of summer nears and her first roller derby bout draws closer, Astrid realizes that maybe she is strong enough to handle the bout, a lost friendship, and middle school… in short, strong enough to be a roller girl. Why I Love Astrid : She always gets up when she falls down! Plus – she’s into roller derby. Raina from Smile by Raina Telgemeier Raina just wants to be a normal sixth grader. But one night after Girl Scouts she trips and falls, severely injuring her two front teeth. What follows is a long and frustrating journey with on-again, off-again braces, surgery, embarrassing headgear, and even a retainer with fake teeth attached. And on top of all that, there’s still more to deal with: a major earthquake, boy confusion, and friends who turn out to be not so friendly. Why I Love Raina : She’s hilarious and endearing and so very relatable. Rose Howard from Rain Reign by Ann M. Martin Rose Howard is obsessed with homonyms. She’s thrilled that her own name is a homonym, and she purposely gave her dog Rain a name with two homonyms , which, according to Rose’s rules of homonyms, is very special. Not everyone understands Rose’s obsessions, her rules, and the other things that make her different – not her teachers, not other kids, and not her single father. When a storm hits their rural town, rivers overflow, the roads are flooded, and Rain goes missing. Rose’s father shouldn’t have let Rain out. Now Rose has to find her dog, even if it means leaving her routines and safe places to search. Why I love Rose : She has a plan and she executes it despite the odds. She does the right thing even at the expense of her own desires. Favorite Quote : “Everyone calls me brave. Is this what bravery feels like? ” Cece from El Deafo by Cece Bell Going to school and making new friends can be tough. But going to school and making new friends while wearing a bulky hearing aid strapped to your chest? That requires superpowers! In this funny, poignant graphic novel memoir, author/illustrator Cece Bell chronicles her hearing loss at a young age and her subsequent experiences with the Phonic Ear, a very powerful—and very awkward—hearing aid. The Phonic Ear gives Cece the ability to hear—sometimes things she shouldn’t—but also isolates her from her classmates. She really just wants to fit in and find a true friend, someone who appreciates her as she is. After some trouble, she is finally able to harness the power of the Phonic Ear and become “El Deafo, Listener for All. ” And more importantly, declare a place for herself in the world and find the friend she’s longed for. Why I love Cece : She’s finds joy and humor in every circumstance. Favorite Quote : “Oh, why do I even care what other people think? ” Anne Shirley from Anne of Green Gables by L. M. Montgomery When the Cuthberts send to an orphanage for a boy to help them at Green Gables, their farm in Canada, they are astonished when a talkative little girl steps off the train. Anne, red-headed, pugnacious and incurably romantic, causes chaos at Green Gables and in the village. Why I love Anne : Her verbosity, her quickness of temper, and her big dreams never cease to amaze me. Favorite Quote : “Oh, it’s delightful to have ambitions. I’m so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to be any end to them– that’s the best of it. Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does make life so interesting. ” Lucky from The Higher Power of Lucky by Susan Patron Lucky, age ten, can’t wait another day. The meanness gland in her heart and the crevices full of questions in her brain make running away from Hard Pan, California , the rock-bottom only choice she has. It’s all Brigitte’s fault–for wanting to go back to France. Guardians are supposed to stay put and look after girls in their care! Instead Lucky is sure that she’ll be abandoned to some orphanage in Los Angeles where her beloved dog, HMS Beagle, won’t be allowed. She’ll have to lose her friends Miles, who lives on cookies, and Lincoln, future U. S. president and member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. Just as bad, she’ll have to give up eavesdropping on twelve-step anonymous programs where the interesting talk is all about Higher Powers. Lucky needs her own–and quick. Why I love Lucky : She’s funny and loyal and follows her heart. Favorite Quote : “It made her feel discouraged, like if you took the word apart into two sections of dis and couraged. It was getting harder and harder to stay couraged. ” Mona Melendy from The Saturdays by Elizabeth Enright Meet the Melendys! The four Melendy children live with their father and Cuffy, their beloved housekeeper, in a worn but comfortable brownstone in New York City. There’s thirteen-year-old Mona, who has decided to become an actress; twelve-year-old mischievous Rush; ten-and-a-half-year-old Randy, who loves to dance and paint; and thoughtful Oliver, who is just six. Tired of wasting Saturdays doing nothing but wishing for larger allowances, the four Melendys jump at Randy’s idea to start the Independent Saturday Afternoon Adventure Club . If they pool their resources and take turns spending the whole amount, they can each have at least one memorable Saturday afternoon of their own. Before long, I. S. A. A. C. is in operation and every Saturday is definitely one to remember. Why I love Mona : She had the perfect idea for what she wanted to do on her Saturday, and if I were in her shoes I would choose the exact same excursion. Matilda Wormwood from Matilda by Roald Dahl Matilda is a sweet, exceptional young girl, but her parents think she’s just a nuisance. She expects school to be different but there she has to face Miss Trunchbull, a kid-hating terror of a headmistress. When Matilda is attacked by the Trunchbull she suddenly discovers she has a remarkable power with which to fight back. It’ll take a superhuman genius to give Miss Trunchbull what she deserves and Matilda may be just the one to do it! Why I love Matilda : She’s small but she’s powerful! Favorite Quote : “So Matilda’s strong young mind continued to grow, nurtured by the voices of all those authors who had sent their books out into the world like ships on the sea. These books gave Matilda a hopeful and comforting message: You are not alone. ” Sara Crewe from A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett Alone in a new country, wealthy Sara Crewe tries to settle in and make friends at boarding school. But when she learns that she’ll never see her beloved father gain, her life is turned upside down. Transformed from princess to pauper, she must swap dancing lessons and luxury for hard work and a room in the attic. Will she find that kindness and generosity are all the riches she truly needs? Why I love Sara : She never stops caring for others even when she loses everything. Favorite Quote : “If nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out of that–warm things, kind things, sweet things–help and comfort and laughter–and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all. ” Laura Ingalls Wilder from The Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder Set during the pioneer days of the late 1800s and early 1900s, Laura Ingalls Wilder’s books chronicle her life growing up on the Western frontier. Why I love Laura : She’s impulsive and brave and unabashedly herself. Favorite Quote : “She thought to herself, “This is now. ” She was glad that the cozy house, and Pa and Ma and the firelight and the music, were now. They could not be forgotten, she thought, because now is now. It can never be a long time ago. ” Ramona Quimby from the Ramona series by Bevely Cleary Kids everywhere feel connected to Ramona’s unique way of looking at the world as she tries to adjust to new teachers, feels jealous about Susan’s curls, and is secretly pleased by Yard Ape’s teasing. The scrapes she gets herself into—like wearing pajamas to school or accidentally making egg yolk shampoo—are funny and heartwarming, and sometimes embarrassing. No matter what—Ramona’s lively, curious spirit shines through. Why I love Ramona : How could you not love her? She’s her own person and doesn’t care who knows it. Favorite Quote : “She was not a slowpoke grownup. She was a girl who could not wait. Life was so interesting she had to find out what happened next. ” Pippi from Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren Tommy and his sister Annika have a new neighbor, and her name is Pippi Longstocking. She has crazy red pigtails, no parents to tell her what to do, a horse that lives on her porch, and a flair for the outrageous that seems to lead to one adventure after another!

Nor did I kill seals for their sinews, using instead kelp to bind the things that needed it. Nor did I kill another wild dog, nor did I try to speak another sea elephant. Ulape would have laughed at me, and other would have laughed, too — my father most of all. Yet this is the way I felt about the animals who had become my friends and those who were not, but in time could be. If Ulape and my father had come back and laughed, and all the other had come back and laughed, still I would have felt the same way, for animals and birds are like people, too, though they do no talk the same or do the same things. Without them the earth would be an unhappy place. ” Esperanza from Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan Esperanza thought she’d always live with her family on their ranch in Mexico–she’d always have fancy dresses, a beautiful home, and servants.

"Given the 4200-plus page count of the first five titles in A Song of Ice and Fire , the book series upon which HBO’s Game of Thrones is based, it’s no surprise that the series’ creators would have to take Areo Hotah's gigantic axe to several of George R. R. Martin’s minor—and even some of his major—characters. Those on this list might not have gotten their day in the premium cable sun , but they’ll forever live on in the hearts of readers. For some reason, showrunners D. B. Weiss and David Benioff gave the old heave-ho to Game of Thrones ’ resident creepy psychic clown, Patchface. In the books, Patchface is Stannis’ court jester and one of the only friends his daughter Shireen has. Stannis’ father Steffon discovered the young slave while on a mission overseas and bought his freedom, hoping to bring him home to entertain his sons. Patchface made it there, but neither of Stannis’ parents did: They both perished in a shipwreck, of which Patchface was the sole survivor. He washed up on shore three days later, half-mad, and with no memory of how he survived. Now, he speaks mostly in rambling riddles that occasionally do things like predict the Red Wedding . For an extra layer of creep, the name “Patchface” comes from his face and head being tattooed with a pattern of red and green squares. When Yara Greyjoy can only get about five minutes of screen time in any given season, it’s no surprise that her three uncles— Victarion , Euron , and Aeron Greyjoy —have been cut completely. In the books, they’re part of a massive power struggle that takes place in the Iron Islands and has begun to bleed outward to other territories. Victarion, the axe-wielding leader of the Iron Islands’ navy, is even a POV character, with one chapter each in books four and five. Euron is the series’ resident pirate, and Aeron is a religious fanatic who worships the Drowned God. In the first episode of Game of Thrones ’ fifth season, Tyrion makes clear his intention to book it with Varys to Meereen so that he can meet with Daenerys Targaryen to determine whether she’s worth supporting. In the books, he wanders around being drunk a lot before eventually working his way into Daenerys’ sphere of influence . One of his companions on his not-so-merry travels is a young dwarf named Penny who, with her brother Oppo, used to make a living as entertainers … like, say, at Joffrey’s wedding to Margaery, where they were hired to ride around on a pig and a dog, humiliating Tyrion in the process. A different version of that scene made it to the show, but Penny did not. A popular fan theory suggests that Penny is Tyrion’s daughter, which would make it really weird that she has a massive crush on him. The sadistic leader of a company of soldiers that was at one point employed by the Bolton family, Vargo Hoat is responsible for the loss of Jaime Lannister’s hand and Brienne of Tarth’s near-death by bear. If that sounds familiar, it’s because Hoat was replaced in the show by Locke , who fulfilled the same narrative purpose as Hoat but was nonetheless a very different character. While Hoat is a mercenary who starts out working for Tywin Lannister before switching allegiances to Roose Bolton, for example, Locke and his cohorts are loyal servants of Ramsay Bolton through and through. Vargo Hoat never went to the Wall, as Locke did in season four; instead, he was killed by Gregor Clegane at Harrenhal. And the most obvious difference: While Locke is a serious sort of fellow, Vargo Hoat was a somewhat ridiculous character most memorable for his trademark lisp . A bastard son of King Robert Baratheon, Edric Storm was conceived when Robert and a noblewoman named Delena Florent got frisky on Stannis Baratheon’s wedding night . Subsequently, Stannis was a little frosty toward his illegitimate nephew and ordered that he be raised at his little brother Renly’s court at Storm’s End. Later, Stannis brought the child—now about 12 years old, polite and charming, but also proud with an anger streak —back to his court at Dragonstone, which didn’t exactly bode well for Edric given that it put him under the same roof as a priestess whose favorite hobby is sacrificing people with royal blood. Davos Seaworth, worried for the young bastard’s life, spirited Edric across the Narrow Sea. Presumably, he’s in the Free Cities now, thanking every God he can think of that he got out of Westeros before characters started dropping like flies. Edric’s storyline was absorbed in the show by Gendry , who at this point in the books is still kicking around Westeros. Like Vargo Hoat and Edric Storm, Jeyne Westerling was shuffled off to the side so that a different character could take her place on the show. The daughter of a poor noble family and the wife of Robb Stark , Jeyne nursed her future husband back to health when he was wounded during a battle. It was while he was under Jeyne’s care that Robb learned of the deaths of his brothers, Bran and Rickon, and that Winterfell had been burned to the ground. He’s grieving, she comforts him, they have sex, and Robb marries her to protect her honor. Their story isn’t one of grand, star-crossed romance like what Robb and Jeyne’s TV counterpart had, but they still love each other, as evidenced by Jeyne’s grief following Robb’s death. Unlike Talisa, Jeyne didn’t attend the Red Wedding and is still alive in the books. There’s some hinting that she may be pregnant with Robb’s child, though knowing Martin that could easily be a red herring. Though he’s a relatively minor character in the grand scheme of things, Strong Belwas is nonetheless a fan favorite, so many were disappointed when he was one of the first characters to be cut from the show, all the way back in season one. A eunuch and former slave in the fighting pits of Meereen, he and Barristan Selmy join up with Daenerys in A Clash of Kings and become two of her most trusted advisors. Belwas is still alive in the books, throwing his massive weight around and going up against the champion of Meereen. It’s a memorable scene that Michiel Huisman’s Daario Naharis got in the show. Instead of urinating on the ground in front of the city to show his disrespect for its masters, Belwas did . the other thing. It caused quite a stir among fans when Arianne Martell was cut from Game of Thrones . The oldest child of new season five character Doran Martell , in the books Arianne is heir to the throne of Dorne despite having two younger brothers, because the Dornish don’t care for primogeniture, thank you very much. Further, Arianne is a POV character and a major player in A Feast for Crows . Cutting her out, said some, deprived the show of both its “ most feminist plotline ” and of an oasis of gender equality amidst all the sexual violence and oppression of women in the rest of the show. Given that the official cast description of Arianne’s brother Trystane lists him as the heir to Dorne , she is unlikely to make her small-screen debut. But she’s not the only Martell that happened to. Ahhh, Quentyn. Poor, clueless Quentyn. In a major A Dance with Dragons plotline, Doran Martell’s oldest son is sent in secret to Meereen to bring Daenerys back to Dorne as his wife, as per an old agreement that would bind the Martell and Targaryen families together so that they could reclaim the Iron Throne. Quentyn is a very typical fantasy character: the dashing young prince who embarks on a noble quest to go up against dragons and win the heart of a beautiful young princess . Of course, because this is George R. R. Martin we’re talking about, things don’t end well for Quentyn. Daenerys has no interest in marrying some kid she’s never met, and his attempts to prove himself worthy by taming her dragons ends in his painful, fiery death. As of the end of A Dance with Dragons , Doran has yet to find out that his middle child has been roasted alive. Finally, we have Coldhands, one of two characters whose omission from the show is most conspicuous for many book readers. , whereas Coldhands’ ship has all but sailed. ) Though he looks like a wight, unlike his brethren, Coldhands is able to talk and has proven himself to be a helpful ally to some of our heroes in their adventures North of the Wall. Basically, he’s the Friendly Neighborhood Ice Zombie. There are a number of fan theories about Coldhands’ true identity—Ned Stark’s missing-in-action brother Benjen , the Night’s King , Ser Waymar Royce —and what his end game is. Despite how popular a subject he is for fannish speculation, he has been written out of the show entirely. Like some of the other characters on this list, he could in theory still show up in some form, but given how the show’s already breezed past all of what would have been his key scenes, a television role is not looking good for Coldhands.

"There is the last time for everything. So this is the time for my final post. Through this semester I’ve learned a lot about people and their book characters. Now I can tell that I know some of my friends a little bit better, and that my to-be-read pile of books have some additions to it. My friends taught me a lot of useful things, like Anna, who taught me that it’s the author who stands behind any great character, and they told me about things that fictional people can teach you, like Evgeniya whom Scarlett O’Hara taught that people can be strong when they need to. I developed a lot in technological aspect: Twitter, WordPress, Thinglink, video editing and whole bunch of useful stuff that will certainly help me further. All this weeks I was asking one simple and logical question: Who is your favorite book character? And I never answered that question myself. Well, considering that this is my last post I will do it. I was thinking very hard about it this several month, and I realized that for me it is not one character, but many. They all have something I like in them, sometimes things that contradict each other, which makes it even harder to choose. Nut I finally stopped on one: Lisbeth Salander , one of the main characters of Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . The book is the first one in the series, which consists of three books. Many people find this books disturbing and harsh. However, the plot is so complicated that it’s pointless to try to explain it. So let’s talk about the character herself. Lisbeth is a very talented world-class hacker with a photographic memory, and her work is to gather information for one of the security agencies. She is one of those characters whose past is very important, as it influenced her current state in life. As a teenager Lisbeth has overcome some problems that left her under a supervision of the mental institution. However, it is very complicated to conclude about her mental state: it is clear that she is not insane and she does not have any problems in part of education, but she can be violent, and most of the time acts like a sociopath. She is constantly being claimed violent and insane in the books, while readers know that she is not, and all her acts of violence have some justification. “Don’t ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she’ll get a bigger gun. ” – says one of the characters about Salander. Lisbeth Salander is a very strong character in a way that is hard to explain. After all the things she lived through during her childhood, she still manages to function as a normal human being. Also, her way of thinking leaves me absolutely fascinated. She is independent and outstanding. Of all the books I have read I have never read about someone like Salander. I admire her strength, will, and the way she never gives up. Now I finally know who is my favorite book character, though this character is really hard to explain. I don’t know if Lisbeth Salander will tell my readers something about my personality, but I am proud of loving her. So off I go to revisit amazing miss Salander, as now I feel some kind of nostalgia, and I will leave you on this note. Read and be happy 🙂 And have a look at the books once again 😀 Follow me on Facebook and Twitter ! Well this week was very exciting for me, and it brought me to this post. I don’t have anyone this week, due to traveling to Poland. However, I managed to visit the most magical place on Earth, which is Massolit bookshop in Krakow, Poland. Massolit books & cafe is a place not far away from the center of Krakow. Cozily tucked in one of the neighborhoods, this bookplace has used and new books in English. The cafe is a one big room, filled with bookshelves from bottom to ceiling. You can find every genre, from classics to poetry. One special thing about this place is the second part of the shop. There is a sign above the door, which directs you to another part of the building, the separate apartment filled with books. Books there are more classified, and one can find books on media studies, children literature, women studies, Russian studies, Polish studies, Jewish studies and more and more and more. This slideshow requires JavaScript. We spent two hours exploring that fascinating place. After buying stack of books, we settled on one of the small tables with coffee and cookies. This place is pure magic for someone who is into books. I wish I could stay there forever, in this atmosphere of books, coffee and sweets. This week’s victim is my good friend Evgeniya Samsonova. I’ve been preparing to interview her for couple of weeks, so today after a cup of good coffee she told me who is her favorite character. Evgeniya’s favorite book character turned out to be one very known lady – Scarlett O’hara from Gone with the Wind. The book was published in 1936, and it takes place in the period of American Civil War. This book is one of the classic ones, that everybody knows by name . Scralett O’hara is the main character of this famous novel by Margaret Mitchell and the plot follows her life. Scarlett is one of the characters who change through the book. In the beginning we see her as rich and spoilt girl she may seem. Scarlett is beautiful, and she knows and uses it. She thinks only about herself and doesn’t know how to do something by herself. at some point her life goes not the way she expected to and she has to adapt. As book goes Scarlett changes. She becomes capable of doing things herself, starts thinking not only about herself, but about people around her. She turns into a responsible and kind person, who helps those who need help. Evgeniya told that this change is exactly what she likes the most about Scarlett. “ On her example we can see, that people can change. They can strong when they need to. ” Evgeniya likes Scarlett because she was capable of anything, as she knew that she can do anything. And that’s what she loves about her favorite book character. Now take a look at Evgeniya’s cozy room and, of course at her desk with books: And if interested take a look at Thinglink: Follow me on Facebook and twitter 🙂 Today during our class we learned how to create a story on Storify . This creation helps to visualize story using tweets, facebook, and other websites. So here is my very first Storify story. The Goodreads Choice Awards is in process now, and it is escalating really quickly. Do you have any prediction on who is going to win? I hope my favorite books are going to win 🙂 The first post after the break is going to be something new. This week my friend Anna Bashuk opened a new side of book characters to me. And that’s what I’m going to share with my readers today. When I asked Anna about her favorite character, she told me she doesn’t really have one. However, Anna is a different case. She told me that she doesn’t really have a favorite characters, as she never perceives characters in books as real people. Characters are created by real people, and they are the way they are only because author wanted to create them this way. “The person who is inside the book is mainly the fantasy of the author. ” So, all incredible qualities of our favorite characters are a work of real person’s mind. And, as Anna says, it all depends on the way author wants to show them. Of course, Anna likes some book characters, but she doesn’t have a favorite one. “I like people, who stand out in the books, ” she says. Sometimes, this characters are negative, which don’t say us anything about Anna’s own character. For her, it is just the mastery of an author, who managed to make the character interesting and outstanding. “The way I like them is not because of their personal features, but because of the way they are portrayed. If they are strong characters I will like them. ” You can check the Storify here 🙂 Time flies too fast! It is already the middle of the semester, which means that it’s time for a midterm post 🙂 Well, after month and a half of this hard work of finding people with interesting favorite book characters, I can tell that I am pretty much satisfied. This time helped me to learn a lot of new about people I thought I know pretty well. Knowing favorite characters helped me to better understand these people. From Ivaylo I learned that maybe we like characters who depict something that we need in our lives. “Well, I think that everyone needs a Tyler Durden of their own, ” he told me. For Masha and her character, Tatiana, I discovered that they actually have something alike, though some things are absolutely different. For Kaja and Onegin, I learned that sometimes we can love characters despite their flaws. “I still find him likable in his own fault and selfishness, ” said Kaja back then . From Gaukhar I heard about Holden Caulfield from “Catcher in the Rye”. And after having a talk with her I realized that we can love characters we would never like if they were real people close to us. With Maria and the main character of “Shantaram”, Lin, I found out that we tend to like book characters we understand and can relate to. But, honestly, it differs from person to person. And the main thing I achieved is that now I understand that we love characters who help us in some way. The ones, who push us forward, help us to discover new places , change our worldview, and just teach us something people around us never taught us. Read books. People there may not be real, but they may help you to develop as a person and give you something valuable. People always say: ” I feel like characters in this book are real. ” I will tell you a secret: they are, as long as you discover something new with their help. That’s what I learned in the first half of this semester. Here are my wonderful books 🙂 And nooow the video with my books 🙂 As my miidterm exam , I had to make a post about recent books related news. I immediately thought about J. K. Rowling’s tweeter riddle , which she used as a trigger to announce the upcoming movie based on the book “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them. ” Potterheads all over the world got overly excited about coming back to the magical world. Even more exciting for people is a chance to see the beasts we all read about, but have never seen in the movies. the book basically tells us a story about Newt Scamander, who dedicated his life after graduation from Hogwarts to discovering magical creatures all over the world. Here at AUBG we have a collection of Harry Potter books and a lot of fans of this book series. One of my former interviewees Ivaylo Stefkov agreed to share his opinion on the production of the new magic movie. He heard about book long time ago, and is looking forward to seeing the movie. “When I learned that there will be another movie adaptation, I was thrilled, ” says Ivaylo. However, some people are frustrated that the movie did not involve Harry Potter or his friends . Though, everyone is still pretty excited about seeing Hogwarts and magical Scotland again. “It is still going to be set in the Harry Potter universe, so I\m happy about that, ” says Ivaylo. So, if you are Harry Potter fan , raise your wands and grab your cloaks – magic is going to come back on big screens! Here’s a news package about the coming movie ! And follow me on Facebook and Twitter ! Hello again 🙂 This week we are going to visit India with Maria Altergot and her favorite character. Maria is a sophomore from Russia. Though I know her for a year, I’d never asked her, who is her favorite book character before today. Maria found that such decision is a hard one to make, but after couple of days of thinking about it she chose Lin, the main hero of the novel by Gregory David Roberts “Shantaram” , which she is currently reading. In couple of words the novel is about escaped convict from Australia who fled maximum security prison. And where do you think he decides go with his false passport? Bombay, India! One of the features of the book is that Lin comes to Bombay with absolutely no knowledge about Indian culture. He has to adapt and merge with this new surrounding. Maria says that she can understand Lin throughout the book, imagining the way Western person would feel after suddenly finding himself in India. “I can quite understand the way he thinks, and the problems that he experiences, and that misunderstandings. ” This book takes us to exotic and unknown India. Together with Lin reader meets new people, learns about new culture, explores new places, and discovers Indian traditions. Lin helps you see India in the way only person from the outside can describe it, and we all know that the point of view of native people and people from abroad visiting a country usually vary. So this way Lin helps you understand Indian people better, and therefore you start understanding their views on life. Maria says that this book really gives her a feeling of Indian culture. This book with a charismatic main character takes away your sleep and makes you eager to pack your things and leave to India even in the middle of hard semester. Follow me on Facebook and Twitter 🙂 In the last two posts I was mostly interacting with Russian literature. This week I was talking with Gaukhar Murzagalieva about her favorite character. Gaukhar’s favorite bookish person is Holden Caulfield from J. D. Salinger’s “The Catcher in the Rye”. This book is perceived as a classical novel, which vividly illustrates life of teenagers. Holden Caulfield is a main character and the narrator of this novel. Holden describes a few days of his sixteen-year-old life just after he was expelled from boarding school. The way Holden behaves and the slang he uses even now keeps “The Cather in the Rye” in the banned books list. People usually fall into two categories after reading this book: the ones who like Holden, and the ones who hate him. Holden has an extraordinary for that time view on life. His cynicism, criticism of the society and people, and intelligence make him different, someone who doesn’t want to follow the flow and accept all of the ideas of the society of that time period. Holden is a child from “elite”. However, he never thought about himself as about someone from high society. “He just goes against all the rules, norms, and traditions of this society, ” explained Gaukhar. “ He sees these people as hypocrites hiding behind the masks. ” Holden enjoys himself in the way he is not the same as these people around him. And he tries not to behave like them. Holden never plans anything ahead . He decides everything on spot, follows impulse and never thinks about consequences. When asked about what she likes the most in Holden, Gaukhar smiled at me and said: “The thing I like in him is that he is realistic about life. He just lives in the moment. I like attitude to life. He is spontaneous and unpredictable. ” Gaukhar said that Holden’s cynicism passed over to her. She told me that after reading that book she could not trust people as much as she did before, she was no more so naive. “Now I understand that the world is not that simple. It’s not so kind. ” Gaukhar said. However, she confessed that she would not like to be friends with such person in real life. On pages of the books it is amazing and exciting. Gaukhar likes to read about people who are not like her in some way. She can’t really relate to Holden, as she says that she is not that fearless, but she likes his character, his life values, and the way he lives. This week I learned that not all of us choose characters to whom we relate somehow. But maybe the ones who have something we would like to develop in us one day.

' Most of Benedict Cumberbatch's adoring fans first learned of the hawkishly handsome Brit through his radical, brilliant reinterpretation of detective Sherlock Holmes on the BBC's Sherlock . However, Cumberbatch's pre- Sherlock career saw him embodying a number of famous literary characters, including a creepy pedophile in Atonement and a priggish debate team captain in Starter for 10 . Not to mention the time he played both Victor Frankenstein and Frankenstein's monster! With Cumberbatch returning to the big screen this winter as the dragon Smaug in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug , let's revisit his best book character roles. 1. Men Without Women The Man, Hills Like White Elephants Sadly, any video links to this short film based on Ernest Hemingway's unsettling short story seem to have been taken down. It's a shame, because we would have liked to see Cumberbatch as the nameless man who tries to convince his girlfriend to get an abortion. 2. Starter for Ten Patrick Watts, Starter for 10 Most people know the adaptation of David Nicholls' prep school debate team novel for James McAvoy's starring role, but Cumberbatch steals the show as the priggish team captain. 3. Atonement Paul Marshall, Atonement Cumberbatch's roles have run the gamut from silly to serious--and he's never shied away from the creepy. Everyone who saw Atonement can't forget his role as predatory chocolate magnate Marshall, especially for the scene in which he lewdly instructs Briony's underage cousin that, when it comes to chocolate, "" You must bite it! 4. The Other Boleyn Girl William Carey, The Other Boleyn Girl Continuing his skeevy roles, Cumberbatch played Mary Boleyn's simpleton husband. When Henry VIII invites Mary to court to be his mistress, William is all too happy to be cuckolded--because at least he gets to live in a castle! 5. The Moving Finger Luke Fitzwilliam, Marple: Murder Is Easy While the TV adaptation of Agatha Christie's mystery downplays some of Detective Fitzwilliam's agency in solving the crime of a village filled with suspicious deaths, he still provides a keen foil for Miss Marple. BOOKISH: Reading resolutions for 2014 BOOKISH: Best books for 'Gravity' movie fans BOOKISH: Minor book characters who got a boost on film or TV 6. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Speaking of detectives…! It is impossible to now envision Arthur Conan Doyle's classic sleuth without seeing Cumberbatch's fast-talking, abrasive, oh-so-superior skills of deduction. Yet, it's in turning Holmes into such an arrogant, detached figure that Cumberbatch also wins us over with his rare moments of warmth toward John Watson . 7. Frankenstein Victor Frankenstein/Creature, Frankenstein It's not enough that Danny Boyle's ambitious National Theatre production was broadcast to international movie audiences. Even more radical was the choice to have Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller--who, in another related twist, plays the American Sherlock Holmes on Elementary --take turns portraying both Frankenstein and his Creature. Several reviewers cited Cumberbatch's Creature as the performance to watch, though The New York Times also praised his take on the less-sympathetic character of Victor. 8. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Peter Guillam, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy In a spy thriller, you have to appreciate the actors who have the tricky job of playing the most layered characters. As Smiley's right-hand man, Cumberbatch shifts between blind devotion and mounting paranoia over whether or not he can trust his boss. 9. The Hobbit Smaug, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug While much attention has been given to Cumberbatch's looks, it's fun to sit back and enjoy just one aspect of his being--here, the silky, menacing voice of the dragon Smaug. In the absence of Andy Serkis' Gollum, he delightfully steps into the "" ominous CGI creature"" breach. BOOKISH: The very best books of 2013 BOOKISH: Bookish editors nominate their favorite books for awards 10. 12 Years a Slave William Ford, 12 Years a Slave In Steve McQueen's devastating film on slavery, Cumberbatch plays William Ford, the archetypal "" slave owner with a heart of gold"" Though he plays into the slavery system, he gives Solomon Northrup the best possible existence he could have before he's traded off to the sadistic Epps . 11. August: Osage County "" Little"" Charles Aiken, August: Osage County Moviegoers are flocking to Tracy Letts' dysfunctional family drama primarily for the showdown between matriarch Meryl Streep and daughter Julia Roberts, but at least one review teases some fun for Cumberbatch fans, with "" the revelation of an entirely new side of Cumberbatch Khan as it gets here).

" The Book Thief is a 2005 historical novel by Australian author Markus Zusak and is his most popular work. Published in 2005, The Book Thief became an international bestseller and was translated into several languages. It was adapted into a 2013 feature film of the same name . After the death of Liesel's younger brother on a train to Molching, Liesel arrives at the home of her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, distraught and withdrawn. During her time there, she is exposed to the horrors of the Nazi regime , caught between the innocence of childhood and the maturity demanded by her destructive surroundings. As the political situation in Germany deteriorates, her foster parents conceal a Jewish fist fighter named Max Vandenburg. Hans, who has developed a close relationship with Liesel, teaches her to read, first in her bedroom, then in the basement. Recognizing the power of writing and sharing the written word, Liesel not only begins to steal books that the Nazi party is looking to destroy, but also writes her own story, and shares the power of language with Max. One night, Max secretly leaves the Hubermanns' home because he thinks he is trouble for the Hubermanns. He is caught by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp with Liesel watching. Quite a long time later, bombs fall on Molching, blasting the Hubermanns' home and killing the Hubermanns, but not Liesel, as she was in the basement writing her book. It is later told that Max survived the concentration camp. We also are exposed to the personality of death as the narrator. Over the course of the book he proves to be a morose, yet caring character. Death , the collector of souls, arrayed in any or all the world's colors when it comes, narrates the story of a young girl coming of age during horrific times—that of Nazi Germany and World War II . To the reader, Death insists that it "" most definitely can be cheerful"" even affable, but also relates that it most certainly cannot be nice. And sometimes Death is "" compelled"" to take action in sympathy with the human story. The protagonist of the story is an adopted girl on the verge of adolescence, with blonde hair that is "" a close enough brand of German blonde"" and a "" smile that is starving"" when she shows it. Her eyes, however, are brown. She is fostered by the Hubermanns after her biological father "" abandons"" their family, her brother dies, and her mother is forced to send her to a foster home due to her belief , which is forbidden at the time. Liesel is the "" book thief"" referred to in the title. Liesel is fascinated by the power of words, as shown in the quotation, "" I have hated the words and I have loved them. She steals books from snow, fire, and the mayor's wife. Liesel's foster father and husband of Rosa, Hans is a former German soldier during World War I , accordion player, and painter . He develops a close and loving relationship with Liesel, and becomes a main source of strength and support for her throughout the novel. He, like Liesel, doesn't have much experience with reading. Together, the two help each other with reading and write all the words they learn on a wall in the basement with his cans of white paint. He helps Max because Max's father sacrificed himself to save Hans in World War One. Liesel's sharp-tongued, often abrasive, foster mother, she has a "" wardrobe"" build and a displeased face, brown-grey tightly-cinched hair often tied up in a bun, and "" chlorinated"" eyes. Despite her temper, she is a loving wife to Hans and mother to Liesel. To supplement the household income, she does washing and ironing for five of the wealthier households in Molching. Another, lesser known fact about Rosa, is that she has a penchant for Pacific Tree Walrus blubber. This was revealed to the 'Today Show' in an interview with the author . Liesel's neighbor, Rudy, has bony legs, blue eyes, lemon-colored hair and a penchant for getting in the middle of situations when he shouldn't. Despite having the appearance of an archetypal German, he does not directly support the Nazis. As a member of a relatively poor household with six children, Rudy is habitually hungry. He is known throughout the neighborhood because of the "" Jesse Owens incident"" in which he colored himself black with charcoal one night and ran one hundred meters at the local sports field. He is academically and athletically gifted, which attracts the attention of Nazi Party officials, leading to an attempted recruitment. His lack of support for the Nazi party becomes problematic as the story progresses. Rudy becomes Liesel's best friend and falls in love with her, always trying to get a kiss out of her. A Jewish fist-fighter who takes refuge from the Nazi regime in the Hubermann's basement. He is the son of a WWI German soldier who fought alongside Hans Hubermann, and the two developed a close friendship during the war. He has brown, feather-like hair and swampy brown eyes. During the Nazi reign of terror, Hans agrees to shelter Max and hide him from the Nazi party. During his stay at the Hubermanns' house, Max befriends Liesel, because of their shared affinity for words. He writes two books for her and presents her with a sketchbook that contains his life story, which helps Liesel to develop as a writer and reader, which, in turn, saves her life from the bombs. The wife of the mayor of Molching who employs Rosa Hubermann. She entered depression after the death of her only son in the Great War. Ilsa allows Liesel to visit and read books in her personal library. She also gives Liesel a little black book, which leads Liesel to write her own story, "" The Book Thief"" Liesel's little brother, who died suddenly on the train with his mother and sister, while being transported to their foster parents. Liesel's mother is only mentioned in the story a few times. Liesel's father was taken away by the Nazis prior to the novel starting because he was a Communist, and the reason her mother – Paula Meminger – was taking both her children to foster care was to save them from Nazi persecution. For awhile Liesel writes letters to her mother thinking there is a chance she is still alive. Like Liesel's father, Liesel's mother dies, but Liesel eventually realizes her mother gave her away to protect her. The book is introduced by the character/narrator Death , which underlines that mortality is very present in the lives of each character. Throughout the novel, the deaths of prominent characters reaffirm the presence of mortality. Because the novel takes place during World War II , death and genocide are nearly omnipresent in the novel. Death is presented in a manner that is less distant and threatening. Because Death narrates and explains the reasons behind each character's destruction, as well as explains how he feels that he must take the life of each character, Death is given a sense of care rather than fear. At one point, Death states "" even death has a heart, which reaffirms that there is a care present in the concept of death and dying. Throughout the novel, language , reading , and writing are presented as symbolic elements of expression and freedom. They provide identity and personal liberation to those characters who have, or who gain, the power of literacy—"" the true power of words"" And they provide a framework for Liesel's coming of age. At the beginning of the story shortly after her brother's funeral, Liesel finds a book in the snow, one she is unable to read. Under tutelage by her foster father Hans, she slowly learns to read and write. By the end of the novel, her character arc is largely defined by her progress in reading and writing. The development of Liesel's literacy mirrors her physical growth and maturing over the course of the story. Literacy skills and vernacular speech also serve as social markers. Wealthy citizens in the story are often portrayed as literate, as owning books and even their own libraries, while the poor are illiterate and do not own books. Rosa Huberman's abrasive and oft-times scatological speech towards her family and others is emblematic of the despairing lives of the poorer classes. The Nazi burning of books in the story represents evil incarnate. Symbolically, Liesel's repeated rescues of books from Nazi bonfires represent her reclaiming of freedom and her resistance to being controlled by the all-pervasive state. In the midst of the damage that war, death, and loss have caused Liesel and the other characters in the book, love is seen as an agent of change and freedom. Liesel overcomes her traumas by learning to love and be loved by her foster family and her friends. In the beginning of the novel, Liesel is traumatized not only by the death of her brother and her separation from her only family, but also as a result of the larger issues regarding war-torn Germany and the destruction by the Nazi party. As Liesel's foster father Hans develops a relationship with her, healing and growth are a direct result. This pattern is reflected in the relational dynamic between the Hubermann family and Max. In the midst of governmental policies that reflect on who is worthy of love and acceptance, the Hubermanns' relationship with Max defies the Nazi regime. Further, the love that Max and Liesel develop through their friendship creates a strong contrast to the hate that is the backdrop of the story. The theme of love also intertwines with the themes of identity and language/reading because all of these themes have the purpose of providing freedom and power in the midst of chaos and control. A film adaptation was released on November 2013. It was directed by Brian Percival . Michael Petroni wrote the script. Starring Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as Hans and Rosa Hubermann, Ben Schnetzer as Max Vandenburg, Nico Liersch as Rudy Steiner, and Sophie Nélisse as Liesel Meminger. John Williams wrote the music soundtrack. Much of the movie was filmed in Görlitz, Germany .

"Samantha and Nellie as a Best Friends Set. The Best Friend Characters are companion characters to the Historical Characters . Best Friends are not given unique time periods and wholly share the era and stories of the characters they are paired with. Best Friends are often prominent characters in the main series of their Best Friend; in the Historical Collections , they showed a different aspect of the same time period due to differences in their backgrounds and/or situations. Because of their ties to their companions, they were not generally considered separate collections of their own; and so were often subjected to the same archiving when their companions were. Cécile Rey and Marie-Grace Gardner , while sharing their time period and marketed as each other's best friend, are not considered part of the Best Friends line since they are given equal prominence in their historical time period and share their Central Series books. The Best Friend line debuted in 2004 with the release of Nellie O'Malley , Samantha's best friend, who was released to coincide with the first American Girl Movie , Samantha: An American Girl Holiday and was a main character in both the movie and Samantha's original stories. While it was initially advertised that Nellie was going to be a limited edition doll, overall positive reception prompted American Girl to keep her as a permanent extension of Samantha's collection and expand the line to include other characters. Elizabeth Cole , Emily Bennett , and Ruthie Smithens were each partially released as a tie-in to the upcoming movie of her companion; Ivy Ling was released with the initial debut of Julie Albright 's release. In 2009, Chrissa Maxwell was the only Girl of the Year to have companion characters with Sonali Matthews and Gwen Thompson . Best Friends were given much smaller collections than the Historical Character they were paired with. and while they were never displayed in the Historical's personal outfits, they were marketed as being part of the collection of their companion. Some collectors who prefer the Best Friend often purchase items of the main Historical Character's collection for a Best Friend. Collections were also tied together; when Samantha Parkington 's collection was archived , Nellie O'Malley and her collection were as well. This was also true for Felicity Merriman and Elizabeth Cole ; Chrissa Maxwell , Sonali Matthews and Gwen Thompson ; and Molly McIntire and Emily Bennett . In 2014 American Girl announced that the remaining best friends available for purchase, Ivy Ling and Ruthie Smithens , would be be retired along with Cecile Rey and Marie-Grace Gardner , effectively ending the Best Friends line. One of the many official responses from American Girl was that they were seeking to return the focus of the Historical collections on the main characters themselves; later announcements for BeForever solidified the remarketing of the Historical line. The announcement stirred up frequent public criticism in multiple media outlets, mostly emphasizing the loss of diversity in Historical Characters as Ivy was Asian-American historical character, and Cécile was the only other African-American Character available at the time besides Addy Walker. In Felicity's illustrations and texts until 2005, Elizabeth was shown and described as having brown hair and eyes. In Felicity: An American Girl Adventure , she was played by Katie Henney, who is blonde with blue eyes. The doll was made to resemble the actress and the original illustrations and texts were edited to prevent discrepancies between the books and movie. Emily is not really considered Molly's best or even closest friend; she originally appeared in only one of Molly's Central Series books, Happy Birthday, Molly! , as a temporary house guest seeking refuge from wartime London and was only expected to stay with Molly for a few weeks. She is thus marketed by American Girl as "" Molly's English Friend. It was theorized that because Molly has two best friends , a different character was chosen so that neither one would become more prominent than the other. Since Emily is from England, her story offers a different perspective from Molly's that neither Linda nor Susan could give . The movie Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front gave Emily a greater role and a different backstory than the books, as did the mystery The Light in the Cellar , which fit within Molly's Central Series chronology. Her own book, Brave Emily , mostly focused on the differences between cultures and the Looking Back section discussed English children during wartime. The illustrations of Emily in Happy Birthday, Molly! were edited to reflect the doll's looks; namely, that her hair was lengthened from a bob to shoulder-length and clothes were changed to reflect actual items released. The only major change with Ruthie was the doll being given grey eyes instead of the brown shown in book illustrations . Stirling Howard is also a close friend of Kit's but, since AG at the time did not make boy dolls outside of the Bitty Twins , he was not considered as an option. Other Historical Characters were never given official Best Friend characters. Suspicions were initially that, because all but Rebecca and Caroline have a best friend of color, these characters were not released due to possible prejudice; however, the more probable factor is that the declining popularity of the line resulted in eventual termination before these characters could ever be released. Magnetic Mini Worlds , Paper Doll sets, and Play Scenes and Paper Dolls paired each girl with a "" Best Friend"" Josefina does not technically have a prominent best friend; Clara is her older sister and Mariana was only mentioned in one book and given no further prominence in the series. Both characters were shown in Josefina's Paper Dolls II ; Clara was part of the Magnetic Mini World . Much like Emily was marketed as "" Molly's English Friend"" the Magnetic Mini Worlds list Speaking Rain as "" Kaya's Sister"" and Clara as "" Josefina's Sister. Ana is Rebecca's cousin and has significant presence in the series, as does Lydia in Caroline's. Maryellen Larkin was released after the termination of the best friends line; her primary best friend in her series is Davy Fenstermacher . American Girl did not make boy dolls at the time at her release, so Angela Terlizzi , Karen Stohlman , or Karen King could have qualified. Melody Ellison is not given one specific close friend in her series, though her cousin Valerie Porter or Sharon could qualify. Nanea Mitchell has two noted best friends in her books, Donna Hill and Lily Suda . In MegaConstrux collections for Girls of the Year , possible best friends are represented: ","Cécile Rey,Marie Grace Gardner,Nellie O'Malley,Elizabeth Cole,Emily Bennett,Ruthie Smithens,Ivy Ling,Julie Albright,Chrissa Maxwell,Sonali Matthews,Gwen Thompson,Samantha Parkington,Nellie O'Malley,Felicity Merriman,Elizabeth Cole,Chrissa Maxwell,Sonali Matthews,Gwen Thompson,Molly McIntire,Emily Bennett,Ivy Ling,Ruthie Smithens,Cecile Rey,Marie Grace Gardner,Addy Walker,Felicity,Elizabeth,Felicity,Katie Henney,Emily,Emily,Linda,Susan,Emily,Emily,Ruthie,Stirling Howard,Rebecca,Caroline,Clara,Mariana,Josefina,Clara,Emily,Clara,Josefina,Rebecca,Maryellen Larkin,Davy Fenstermacher,Angela Terlizzi,Karen Stohlman,Karen King,Melody Ellison,Valerie Porter,Sharon,Nanea Mitchell,Donna Hill,Lily Suda"

"Poppy lives near Tokyo with her husband and likes to read novels and play video games, especially fantasy RPGs. The Harry Potter franchise is known worldwide as arguably one of the best fantasy book series of all time. If you read the books before you watched the movies, you probably had an idea, or hope, of how the story would look on-screen, how actors would portray new characters, and whether the scenes matched up to the action in your head. When I watched the movies, some scenes were fantastic, whereas some left me disappointed. The same goes for the characters. Sometimes you could really tell whether actors had read the books or not. Here's a breakdown list of who, in my opinion, played their characters well. To see a list of Harry Potter characters portrayed poorly, see Worst Book to Film Harry Potter Characters. Timothy Spall is a marvellous actor and he did a great job at being the weedy, snivelling Peter Pettigrew, nicknamed Wormtail. I was proud of his job on-screen in The Prisoner of Azkaban and he continued to be flawless in the later films. Spall was a great choice for physical features, too: he could act as a short "" lump"" in the films, sported a bald patch of hair, and could even make his eyes watery and beady. Helena Bonham Carter was the perfect choice for this role! Crazy, dark, and dangerous, Bellatrix's sadistic character obsessed with Voldemort and the dark arts was brought to life by Carter's performance. The insanity, creepiness, and pure evil was portrayed very well by the actress who also appeared in Fight Club , Ocean's 8 , and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . Professor Sybill Trelawney is the Divination teacher, with a dreamy voice and an odd obsession with Harry, whose death she constantly predicts, thoroughly annoying Hermione. Although she's something of a fraud, she is actually much more important than one might think. Emma Thompson did a fantastic job of recreating this teacher who is described in the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book as looking like a "" glittering insect. Everything from her hair to her clothes to her voice was perfect. Thompson did a wonderful portrayal of this key character. One huge character of The Chamber of Secrets was Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who lurked in an abandoned girl's lavatory after being killed by the basilisk. Shirley Henderson did a truly amazing job of portraying this whiny teenager. It is impressive enough that the actress, who was thirty-six years old at the time of filming, could pass as a schoolgirl! She then added to the performance by portraying the character perfectly. Hagrid is the first person from the wizarding world Harry meets after eleven years of thinking he is a normal, non-magical person. He is quite literally a gentle giant - half-giant, anyway - and is firm friends with Harry, Ron and Hermione throughout the series. He loves dangerous animals, often claiming they're 'seriously misunderstood', and lives in a cabin near Hogwarts as gamekeeper. Robbie Coltrane looked perfect as Hagrid - everything from his tangled beard and twinkling eyes to his big heavy boots. The only reason he isn't higher on this list is because he didn't get much on-screen time in the later movies. Nice performance, Coltrane. The Dark Lord himself was played by a talented Ralph Fiennes. He won over the audience in all of the movies from The Goblet of Fire , from his cold gaze to his high-pitched whispering voice that still gives us the chills to this day. Professor McGonagall is a great character in the books. Strict, clever and all-in-all an excellent witch, Professor McGonagall gets Harry onto the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his first year, offers advice and help throughout his schooling without showing favouritism, and leads the battle for Hogwarts in Book 7. Maggie Smith did an excellent job of playing this immensely likeable teacher of Hogwarts - she was slightly intimidating, carrying an air of a very wise witch and great teacher. Thumbs up for Maggie. Argus Filch is the Hogwarts caretaker, who lurks around the castle with his cat, Mrs Norris. In the books he is portrayed as a sneaky, rather dirty Squib who just loves to pick on students and punish them. Argus Filch is hilarious in the movies, and appears regularly enough to be a nuisance for the students. His wheezy voice and constant disgusted. slightly mad look made him a great character in the movies. He is played by David Bradley who is also a character in Game of Thrones . Alan Rickman did a remarkable job as one of the most popular Harry Potter characters, Professor Severus Snape. He hates Harry simply because he is his father's son, and is way more mean in the books than in the films. Nevertheless, Rickman portrayed Snape as the serious, secretive and sarcastic professor who is suspected of being evil, realised to be on Dumbledore's side, suspected evil again, and ultimately proven innocent. He is one of my favourite characters from Harry Potter , and Alan Rickman was most definitely a fantastic choice to play Snape. Everything from his demeanour, to his sarcastic lines to his billowing black cloak and hair is just perfect. One of the best Rickman roles. Dolores Umbridge is delightfully evil. She first appears in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as a Ministry of Magic representative voting for Harry's expulsion from Hogwarts and later as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Over the year, she says that anyone claiming Voldemort is back is lying, punishes students by making them write lines in their own blood, and introduces many new rules from the Ministry to Hogwarts, making herself Headmistress for a short while. She makes life hell for many students of Hogwarts and coupled with this, she wears a sickly pink cardigan and has hideous plates in her office with fluffy kittens on them. This oxymoron of cute and evil makes her a very memorable character. Umbridge was played by Imelda Staunton, and exceptionally, too. She speaks in a sickly-sweet way, interrupts people with her tiny cough , which I was very pleased about as it had been a nice touch in the books, and even wears the pink cardigan. Staunton did a superb job of bringing Umbridge's character to life, and that's why she deserves the number 1 spot. One of the most important parts of any story is the characters, and these great actors brought these loved villains, heroes, and sub-characters to life!

"A marathon of the entire The Lord of the Rings film saga-- The Hobbit movies included-- would take over 20 hours of viewing. We're talking the extended versions, of course, since one does not simply marathon the theatrical cuts. That's a lot of content and any more would be pushing the possibilities of what a film adaptation could fit from its lengthy book counterpart. Because of the amount of content, there are a handful of characters who could not make the leap from the pages, onto the big screen. Some characters were truly missed, like Quickbeam, an Ent who had the bark to answer an elder Ent's question before he even finished asking it, or the kindly elf Gildor, who briefly accompanied Frodo and his friends before Legolas joined the Fellowship. Naturally, the medium of cinema has time constraints that books do not and some characters were best left behind in the imaginations of Middle-earth's adoring fans. Some of the characters listed were either too superfluous or just plain bizarre to make it into The Lord of the Rings movies. Here are the 15 Lord Of The Rings Characters We're Glad Were Left Out Of The Movies . Click the button below to start this article in quick view The Dúnedain were a special subrace of Men who lived long lives well beyond those of typical humans. Aragorn was among this group, which is why he was 87-years-old and still looked extremely young in The Fellowship of the Ring . Some of the surviving Dúnedain became the Rangers of the North, which was a special class that Aragorn also belonged to. While they were rare in the books, in the films Aragorn appeared to be the last of this kind. In The Return of the King novel, Halbard, a Dúnedain, brought thirty soldiers of the shared heritage to accompany Aragorn through his later battles against the forces of Mordor. As cool as it would have been to see an army of long-lived, butt-kicking Aragorns, the film series decided to keep his character unique, and we can appreciate that. The most obvious character missing from The Lord of the Rings movie series is the enigmatic Tom Bombadil. Not only was this plump magic-man missing from Peter Jackson's films, he did not appear in the Ralph Bakshi animated version either. Directors just don't know what to do with the guy. Old Tom had little to do with the main quest of The Lord of the Rings , and only appeared in the first novel, The Fellowship of the Ring. The hobbits met Bombadil early in the journey when they passed through the Old Forest. The ancient, rhyming man showed tremendous power and even proved to be resistant to the temptation of the One Ring-- a power that even Gandalf and Galadriel could not claim to have . Perhaps Tom was too powerful for his own good to appear in the films, as fans would have likely accused him of being a deus ex machina, and we wouldn't want that title taken away from the Great Eagles. Tom Bombadil and his funny little poems are best left in the books. Sometimes there is such a thing as being too awesome. Glorfindel was an elf of impressive reputation. Described in the books as "" tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy, "" Glorfindel came across as the all-mighty dreamboat of The Lord of the Rings franchise. His pre- Fellowship accomplishments included coming back from the dead and defeating a Balrog. In The Fellowship of the Ring novel, it was he who was sent by Lord Elrond to retrieve Frodo Baggins. Do you recall the movie scene where Arwen carried Frodo on her horse in an attempt to escape the Nazgûl and their frightening black steeds? All of that was done by Glorfindel in the books. J. R. R. Tolkien was not known for writing female characters into prominent roles in his stories, so perhaps it was for the best that Glorfindel's actions were switched to Arwen for the theatrical version. Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor proved to be an important battleground in The Return of the King . Hosting the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Minas Tirith needed all the good guys it could get. One such group consisted of Prince Imrahil and his company, the Knights of Dol Amroth, also known as the Swan Knights. While Éomer and his soldiers were outnumbered by the forces of Mordor, Imrahil and company helped even the playing field. The prince was even such a noble leader that he was appointed to rule the city until the rightful leader, Faramir, regained consciousness. As much good as Prince Imrahil did in the books, the movie would have been a bit crowded with another royal hero. Besides, would the audiences have been able to take a group called the Swan Knights seriously? The Druedain were a book-only oddity-- a group of forest-people who lived in huts in the Druadan Forest. They were clearly on the side of good, as they strongly despised Sauron and assisted his foes. Their chief was a short man known as Ghân-buri-Ghân. Towards the end of the war, King Théoden found the need to pass his army through Druadan Forest in order to assist Gondor in their battle against Mordor. Crossing paths with Ghân-buri-Ghân the leaders spoke and realized they had a common goal: to crush Sauron by any means possible. Knowing the area, Ghân-buri-Ghân suggested a secret passageway he could lead the army through. Helpful as he was in the books, the squat chief and his wild tribe would have felt like a strange last minute addition to The Return of the King film-- although it would have been hilarious to watch the characters try to pronounce "" Ghân-buri-Ghân. Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin Took--they're like The Beatles of The Lord of the Rings . They even had their very own Pete Best in Fredegar "" Fatty"" Bolger. Earlier in The Fellowship of the Ring, Fredegar accompanied them on their pre-Rivendell adventures. However, when it was time to traverse the Old Forest, Fredegar chickened out and decided to stay at Frodo's new home in Crickhollow. In house-sitting for Frodo, it was Fredegar's job to make it appear that his hobbit friend was still at home and not off on some grand adventure. This would later backfire when the Nazgûl showed up looking for Frodo and found the chubbier hobbit instead. While an amusing character, it was best that Fredegar's unheroic tale was left out of the movie. Besides, the hobbits should be a far more body positive people than to nickname someone "" Fatty. Second breakfast was a major part of their culture, after all. What would Tom Bombadil be without his equally mysterious wife, Goldberry? Also known as "" the River-daughter, she was cloaked in a dress of green and gold, with long blonde hair to match. The hobbits found themselves enchanted by her presence. She appeared to be some kind of nature spirit connected to rivers. Like a laid back, all-loving, hippie, Goldberry played hostess to the hobbits and gave them a place to eat and sleep. A scene like this would have slowed down the already lengthy plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, so it's understandable that she was left out-- the sooner the hobbits would move on to meet the rest of the Fellowship, the better. Goldberry also somewhat resembled Galadriel as they were both golden, G-named, women living in nature--which would have had the potential of confusing the audience. One of the major differences in the book of The Fellowship of the Ring was the amount of adventuring the hobbits went through before even encountering Aragorn at the Prancing Pony . Not long after leaving the Old Forest, Frodo and his friends once again found themselves in trouble. As they traveled through the Barrow-downs, they encountered a ghostly undead creature, appropriately named the Barrow-wight. Managing to capture Sam, Merry, and Pippin it was up to Frodo to rescue his friends. He was quick to recite a summoning song he learned that brought forth his new companion Tom Bombadil, who then rescued his furry-footed friends from their near death experience by banishing the Barrow-wight once and for all. Considering that this was a chapter featuring Tom Bombadil in the books, it was best left out of the film. Besides, the ghostly presence of the Barrow-wight might have been too similar to the Nazgûl that would menace the Fellowship throughout the movie. Arwen wasn't the only child of Elrond in The Lord of the Rings books. He also had twin sons called Elladan and Elrohir who did not appear in the movies despite being in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King novels. In the books, they joined Halbarad and his army, the Grey Company, and accompanied Aragorn. They were brave enough to travel with him through the Paths of the Dead where Aragorn recruited the ghostly army to his aid them in battle. Elladan and Elrohir would join Glorfindel, as the Rivendell elves who would not show up in the movie. Viewers would have a difficult time telling all of the elves apart if Legolas, Elladan, and Elrohir were all out on a journey together-- especially since two out of three of those elves were twins. There once was a traitorous human who served under Saurmon as a spy. This man was Bill Ferny. When the four hobbits arrived at the Prancing Pony inn, Bill kept an eye on them. He would later report their whereabouts to the Nazgûl, because that's the least a minor villain could do. Not only did he have a small role in The Fellowship of the Ring , but he would eventually resurface in The Return of the King . During the Scouring of the Shire , Bill was one of the humans who helped take over the peaceful hobbit land that Frodo and friends called home, all under the guidance of Saruman. The problem with Bill was that anything said about his description could also apply to the other cowardly servant of Saruman: Grima Wormtongue. The world only has so much room for cowards. The Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul was one of the most thrilling scenes in both the book and movies of The Fellowship of the Ring. The fight, in which the Fellowship battled orcs in an abandoned dwarf city, led to a tense moment where Frodo appeared to be severely-- or maybe even mortally-- wounded. In the book, the culprit was a large orc chieftain with a large spear. In the movie, however, he was replaced by something even better. The movies sought for more visual variety and some extra thrills, so rather than another orc, a fearsome cave troll entered the battle and dealt Frodo the would-be injury. Frodo, of course, had the good luck of wearing the mithril shirt, handed down to him from Bilbo Baggins-- a light piece of armor that spared him from serious injury. The wizards of The Lord of the Rings were unique from their ilk that typically inhabit fantasy stories. Rather than humans who've learned spells from old books, they were angel-like beings called Maia who served Middle-earth in the fight against Sauron . In the films, we saw Gandalf the Grey, Saruman the White, and Radagast the Brown-- who finally showed up in The Hobbit , rather than The Fellowship of the Ring like in the books. In Middle-earth mythology, there were two more wizards out there: Pallando and Alatar of the Blue. Admittedly, the characters only get passing mention in the books. However, it wouldn't have been too surprising if they were somehow shoehorned into the movies, particularly in The Hobbit trilogy where characters such as Legolas were placed in and given expanded roles. As Baron Mordo said in the Doctor Strange movie, this would grant the world, "" too many sorcerers. "" In The Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers only got a taste of Farmer Maggot. Pippin and Merry were seen running from his farm holding mushrooms that they had stolen from his land at the beginning of the film. All we got of Farmer Maggot was his shouty voice and the top of his scythe swinging back-and-forth through a cornfield in pursuit of the thieves. The books were quite different in this respect, as readers spend quite some time with him and his family. In the novel, the farmer and his wife Mrs. Maggot took the boys in, providing them with food and stories. The Maggots were a large family with several sons and daughters, and warmly welcomed the travelers into their household. The encounter was an altogether pleasant experience, and Mrs. Maggot sent the hobbits away with a large basket of mushrooms to eat on the road-- no theft by Pippin and Merry here. The extended encounter wouldn't have worked in the movie and would have padded an already lengthy running time. Some viewers may have felt overwhelmed by the 13 dwarves that journeyed with Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit movies. It was certainly hard to keep track of their rhyming names too. Luckily, we were spared that mental exercise within The Lord of the Rings films. However, if the movies stayed 100% loyal to the books, we would have dealt with another group of dwarves in The Fellowship of the Ring . After Bilbo's 111th birthday shenanigans, he ran back to his home in Bag End and was joined by three dwarf companions. After a struggle to leave the One Ring behind under Gandalf's strict instruction, Bilbo whistled, and the three dwarves popped up out of nowhere, having packed for the journey ahead, and leave with their elderly, hobbit friend. It would have made for an odd moment in the movie version for sure. Especially after such an intense moment between Gandalf and Bilbo. In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug , Bilbo, and his dwarf companions encountered Beorn, the large, intimidating man who could transform into a larger than average bear. In the books, as frightening as he could be, things were a little odd inside the grand home of the wild man. The hall in Beorn's house was like a trip into Alice and Wonderland . It was packed with cows, sheep, horses, and dogs-- all of whom Beorn would hold conversations with. If this wasn't odd enough, some of the animals were capable of walking on two legs , carrying torches, and serving food to their guests like bizarro, furry, waiters. One has to wonder: if Guillermo del Toro had remained the director of The Hobbit , would the more magical animals have remained? Del Toro was interested in having animals capable of speech , as they were in the book. --- Can you think of any other characters who you're glad didn't appear in The Lord of the Rings movies?

Guests dine in a rustic, Enchanted Forest to mimic the iconic movie. 8. Hollywood & Vine One of the best character dining restaurants for the littlest tadpoles is Hollywood & Vine at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. Hosting the Disney Junior Play ‘n Dine for breakfast satisfies the entire family with a hearty buffet. Disney Junior favorites such as Doc McStuffins, Sofia the First, Jake and the Never Land Pirates, Vampirina and Roadster Goofy interact with the little ones. Breakfast features waffles, frittatas and fresh fruit. During lunch and dinnertime, Minnie Mouse and her friends host seasonal dinners with tastes and festivities to reflect the season. Character guests usually include Minnie, Mickey, Donald, Daisy and Goofy in their best seasonal outfits, of course. Minnie’s Seasonal Dining is also eligible for the Fantasmic! Dinner Package. With the dinner package, guests can dine at one of the three participating restaurants before heading over to reserved VIP seats for Fantasmic! the park’s nighttime spectacular. 9. The Crystal Palace at Magic Kingdom Another great restaurant for the little ones is The Crystal Palace, nestled beside the hub in Magic Kingdom. The open, Victorian-style setting is a bright and verdant backdrop for meeting friends from Winnie the Pooh, including Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet and the willy, nilly, silly ole bear himself, Pooh. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, with Pooh and friends present at all three buffet-style meals. The food is classic fare such as fruit, pastries and omelets for breakfast, and carved meats, soups, breads, fish and vegetables at lunch and dinner. Be aware of the timing here. If you are finishing your meal around the same time a parade or fireworks display is ending, it can get a little crowded as you try to make your way back out into the park. 10. ‘Ohana at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort Dynamic duo Lilo and Stitch, along with other classic Disney characters such as Mickey and Pluto, join guests for the Best Friends Breakfast at Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. Breakfast is standard fare of scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, sausage, bacon and fruit served ' ohana style. If you’re looking for a Polynesian-inspired breakfast, head over to Kona. The real allure of ‘Ohana is at dinnertime. No traditional Disney characters appear during dinner, but the evening meal is certainly not lacking in fun as entertainers sing, tell stories and invite guests to join them for games and dancing. The dinner menu at ‘Ohana features our favorite pineapple-coconut bread, followed by salad, pork dumplings, honey-coriander chicken wings, meat skewers, noodles and vegetables, finished with ‘Ohana’s specialty, bread pudding a la mode with bananas-caramel sauce. With the right timing, dinner at ‘Ohana also provides a spectacular view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks. 11. Chef Mickey’s Disney's Contemporary Resort offers a classic buffet-style restaurant serving breakfast, brunch and dinner. At Chef Mickey’s Fun Time Buffet, the Fab Five, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto and Goofy join guests for their meals. The restaurant overlooks Bay Lake, as well as the 90-foot high mural by Mary Blair that has become an icon of the Contemporary Resort. The enormous buffet offers a variety of dishes at every meal. For breakfast, enjoy fresh fruit, cereals and oatmeal, breakfast potatoes, sausage, pancakes and other breakfast favorites. Brunch adds soup, salads and seafood to the breakfast offerings. At dinner, choose from a carving station, pasta, seafood paella and a smorgasbord of sides and desserts. With so many options, this is a great choice for groups with diverse palates as well as picky eaters. Chef Mickey’s is a crowd-pleaser with a few surprises. 12. Cape May Café at Disney's Beach Club Resort Minnie Mouse loves to throw a beach bash! Minnie’s Beach Bash Breakfast at Disney's Beach Club Resort gathers Minnie and her BFF Daisy in their beachy best to start the day sunny side up. Breakfast includes a mix of items from sliced deli meats and cheeses to bagels, scrambled eggs, seasonal fruits and veggies and cereals. This is a relaxed, casual dining experience and perfect if you're staying at one of the Epcot-area resort hotels, but it offers fewer characters than some of other character breakfasts, so it's lower on our list. The Four Seasons also hosts a Good Morning Breakfast with Goofy and His Pals, as does the Garden Grove at the Swan Hotel. However, since these are not exactly official Disney Resorts, they were not included in this ranking. With so many character dining locations, you're sure to find at least one that will make the whole family happy. These are our picks for the best Disney World character dining.

Tags: Disney World , Character Dining , Characters , Walt Disney World Resort Hotels Is there a way to see fireworks without being in the park? Hi Patricia! There are several. At Magic Kingdom specifically, two places we can think of to watch the fireworks are at Trader Sam's at the Polynesian Village Resort, and on the beach at Fort Wilderness. Both places pipe in the music to accompany the fireworks, as well. Frog Pond, where are your other favorite fireworks viewing areas outside of the parks? Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hello! We are heading to WDW in early April. My son's 6th birthday is on April 6th and we will be at Animal Kingdom that day. I would like to plan a special birthday dinner. any suggestions? Also, can we get birthday buttons at any park or only Magic Kingdom? TIA! Hi Kelly! Hoppy birthday to your tadpole! Birthday buttons are available at Guest Relations at any of the parks - so you'll still be able to grab one at Animal Kingdom! Tusker House is a great option - it's got a delicious dinner buffet with something for even the pickiest of eaters, AND you'll get a visit from Safari Donald, Daisy and Mickey. Make sure to note his birthday when making your dining reservation and when you check in - you may get a little something special during your dinner to celebrate! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hello! I will be in Disney for the weekend of the 12th of April taking my children 6 and 12 yr olds, I wanted to know how much does the breakfast buffet at the crystal palace go for? Hi Lorie! This can vary depending on the time of year, so Disney lists this as a range on their website . In our experience, you can expect to spend around $38 per adult and $23 per child for the breakfast buffet, plus tax and gratuity. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hi, Based on recommendations I'd like to try the crystal palace in April. Our twin girls will be 2-1/2 years old. Do you know if there are any special meal discounts for kids under 3 . What is the price structure in general. Based on age? Thanks! Hi Mike! That's exactly right - the pricing structure for the buffets is based on age. Children under 3 are free, and children from 3-9 get the discounted child rate. We hope your girls have a frogtastic time meeting the Hundred Acre Wood crew! ) Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog We are staying in Orlando but not doing Disney. I did make reservations for cape May and chef Mickey. Will it be difficult for us to drive in and park at the resort to eat? Hi Stacy! You shouldn't run into any parking issues; just let the security guard at the resort know that you have a reservation. He'll consult his magical list and grab you a pass : ) Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog I want the main Mickey characters and I can't decide between Chef Mickey or Hollywood & Vine. Are the VIP seats to Fastasmic worth it? I assume that is an extra cost? Hi Liz! Great question. The VIP seats to Fantasmic aren't at an outright extra cost, as they are included with your dining package at Hollywood and Vine, but the cost for your dining experience will be slightly higher than it would be at Chef Mickey's . Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog My kids are big Disney Junior fans, so I made a reservation at Hollywood and Vine for the play and dine breakfast. Are the Disney Junior characters at lunch as well? I’m finding conflicting info online. Lunch would be preferable for us. Help! Hi Andrea! Hoppy to help! It looks like the Disney Junior characters are only around for breakfast, while it's the fab 5 for lunch and dinner. If lunch is better for you, you could change your reservations to lunch and meet Mickey and Minnie and the gang, then visit Animation Courtyard for some Disney Junior meet-and-greets and a dance party ! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hello! Do they have Disney photographers' at Chef Mickey's restaurant? Hi Jenny, They sure do! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog If I do Chef Mickey what time does it start and how far is it from Magic Kingdom Hi Michael, It looks like Chef Mickey's opens around 7 a. m. each morning ! Chef Mickey's is located in the Contemporary Resort, next to Magic Kingdom. You can get there by monorail or by a walkway from Magic Kingdom . Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Do you have to stay at the resort to do the Chef Mickey or any of the other early dining places?

Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Is there a place outside of Disney parks to see Sofia the First? Hi Kathryn! Unfortunately not : fan, Disney's Hollywood Studios is your best bet. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog At the last minute, we are going to Florida the week of thanksgiving. We are planning to spend only one day at Disney world. We are having a hard time finding a character dining experience at the\is late time. Any advice? Hi Amy! The booking window opens each day at 7AM EST, so be sure to check for reservations in the app early . and continue looking even up to the day of your visit. Lots of people may cancel last minute. Check as much as you can - you never know when something may open up! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Are the characters available at all meal times at Akershus and Hollywood and Vine. Which meal is better to do at each place? Hi Wendy! Princesses meet and greet during ALL meals at Akershus, and we love them all. Hollywood and Vine hosts Disney Junior characters for breakfast and lunch, and the classics for dinner. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Are there any character breakfast that have a Christmas theme? We live in the Orlando area so wanted to do something with the grandkids Christmas themed without going into the busy parks any suggestions? Hi Shari! We can't think of any Christmas-themed character meals that aren't inside of the parks. However, Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary is always one of our favorites, and you can check out the hotel's gorgeous gingerbread display! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog We are taking our 4-year old daughter to Orlando first week of November and want to take her for a meal with princess characters like Elena of Avalor. Do you have any recommendations? Unfortunately Cinderella’s Royal table aren’t available. Thanks! Hi there! We don't think Elena of Avalor meets as part of any character dining experiences. We recommend checking out Akershus Royal Banquet Hall at Epcot for another great option to dine with the princesses outside of Cinderella's Royal Table : ) Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog We have a 16 party family vacation scheduled for August 31, 2018 through September 3, 2018, staying at the Cars Hotel. What is the best character breakfast for those NOT purchasing park tickets. We all live in the Orlando area and have visited all of the parks many times. This trip is just fun Disney themed get-a-way without the parks. Thank you. Hi Marcia! OMG - Sounds like so much fun. Chef Mickey's has always been our favorite character breakfast . it's a blast! If your group is interested in princesses, the Bon Voyage Breakfast with Tangled and Little Mermaid characters has some of the best food we've ever had on Disney property. Since these are located at resorts, they don't require park admission. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hi. I'm planning a family holiday this year. The farewell breakfast with Tangled and the Little Mermaid will this still be the same theme next April. I've never been able to meet Eric and my daughter's fave is Rapunzel so is perfect for us but if the characters change I may have a little cry if snow white ended up being there instead. Thanks Hi Kelly, The characters stayed the same from last year, so we would expect them to still be there next year! This is always subject to change, though. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog We are taking our 4-year old daughter to Orlando next week and want to take her for a meal with princess characters like Elsa and Anna. Do you have any recommendations? We are not planning on going into any of the Disney parks. Hi Dina! Unfortunately, Anna and Elsa do not meet for any character meals. You can find them meeting and greeting in Epcot, which would require a park ticket . Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Do all the character meals do something special for Birthdays? I know at Chef Mickey's you get a cupcake but not sure on the others. Hi Nikki! We have had a cupcake come out at all character meals where we have celebrated birthdays. Keep hopping! Leap Hi! You spoke so highly of the Bon Voyage Adventure Breakfast but it’s ranked last. is there a reason? Hi Taylor! The only reason it is ranked lower is because it's more specific in terms of characters. If you or your littles ones aren't huge Little Mermaid or Tangled fans, it might not be the best fit. It's so hard to rank these experiences since they're all so great, but we toad -ally recommend Bon Voyage! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Does Ohana definitely have Mickey? They don't advertise it. Do you know of any other character dining options that feature Mickey . Thanks! Hi Elyssa! Lilo and Stitch are joined by a variety of Disney pals - this could be Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Pluto or a few others. It's always a fun surprise! Keep hopping!

Sounds like you're going to have a great trip. You can absolutely eat at Animal Kingdom Lodge even if you're not staying there. Animals are always grazing around the savanna and you can check them out from the balcony anytime. Our favorite character meal is Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary Resort. You can watch fireworks from the fourth floor balcony afterwards! Keep hopping! Leap Hello, what time are the fireworks? Hi Ania! The fireworks timing depends on the night. You can always check the daily schedule or times guide upon arriving at the park. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog We’re located just north of Derby city centre in the historic Cathedral Quarter, a ten minute walk from the main shopping area and a four minute taxi ride from the train station. Hi guys, thanks for all your great tips. We have booked Cinderella's Royal Table for a 9. 10 breakfast on 7th April 2018 for my birthday. We are staying off site and was wondering what time should We get to Magic Kingdom for to allow time for bag check and entry Into the park? We have never done CRT before & are very excited already. Hi Michelle, That's great! We love Cinderella's Royal Table. We recommend arriving at the park 30-45 minutes before the posted opening time. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Are there any hotel character breakfasts that Minnie appears at? I want to take my daughter who will be turning two but do not want to go to the park. What is the best route you suggest?

Mommy Frog Hi Brittany, Minnie appears at Chef Mickey's at Disney's Contemporary Resort Hotel . Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog We are going to DW December 8th to the 15th. Are all character meals just at breakfast time. We would like to dine in the castle at night so we can see the fireworks well. If would be for 2 adults and one child. I had gastric bypass surgery so could we only order one adult and one kids meal. If yes, what's the cost and menu. Ty and plesss in advance Hi Lynette, Hop over to Disney's site to read about Cinderella's Royal Table prices and menu. You may book reservations on the site too! Hoppy planning!

Any suggestions, it'll be our first trip to Disney so I'll take all the help I can get! : ) Hi Whitney, If you're visiting the Magic Kingdom during an Early Entry day, the restaurants will take reservations during that hour. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hello, I was just wondering if I had to be staying at the grand Floridian hotel to be able to have breakfast at their restaurant. My friend loves Winnie the pooh and I want to make our trip even more magical with a character dinner. Hi Derrick, You do not need to be a staying at a hotel in order to enjoy a character breakfast there. Enjoy! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hi there. I found this post very useful. We will be going to DW in April 2018. I've been told by many that doing the safari first thing in the morning at Animal Kingdom is a must. If we plan on doing that, what time do you recommend making our breakfast reservation at Tusker House? Hi Jennifer, We recommend arriving at the park 45 minutes before the park opens and experiencing Kilimanjaro Safaris first. Make Tusker House reservations for 45/60 after the park's opening time. That should give you time to walk to the attraction, see it, then get ready for breakfast. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog we have a 10yr old boy and a 6 yr old girl which character dining would be best for them. staying on property from 12-27-17 till 1-3-18 not sure what to do Hi Gloria, The best character dining for your kids depends on who they want to meet. For Mickey and pals, Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary Hotel is great. Princesses? Cinderella's Royal Table. Tusker House is our favorite. Lilo and Stitch meet at Ohana Family Breakfast at the Polynesian Hotel. It really depends on who they want to meet. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Looking for a character breakfast easy to get to on Tues am Oct 31st, my husband has vision issues Hi Jennifer, The easiest one to get to really depends on where you are. If you don't want to enter a park, consider Chef Mickey's at Disney's Contemporary Hotel or Ohana's Best Friends Breakfast at Disney's Polynesian Resort. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hi there, Just wondered do any of the princess chracter dining options do a breakfast option and do you know the earliest you can book Thanks Hi Natasha, You can have breakfast with the princesses at Akershus Royal Banquet Hall and Cinderella's Royal Table . You can book up to 180 days in advance of your trip, which we highly recommend doing so! Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Hi! We are planning to visit Disney in October 2017, but are not sure where to go for a character breakfast? We are not staying in a Disney resort. Hi there, Most of the restaurants listed on this post are in the parks, and many of them have breakfast, as well. For instance, Tusker House at Disney's Animal Kingdom has character breakfast and so does The Crystal Palace at Magic Kingdom Park. You also don't need to be staying on-site at a Disney hotel to enjoy their restaurants! Have a great trip. Hoppy planning! Mommy Frog Any word if Moana will be added to any dining options? We're thinking about going to Disney in February. Thanks! Hi Erin, We haven't heard of Moana sailing back to Disney World. We'll keep your frog eyes open to see if she does. Hoppy Planning!

Shooting first and cracking wise, he’s every inch the space cowboy. The Quintessential Solo is heartfelt as well as cocksure, though, and never more so than in Ford’s famously ad-libbed response to Leia’s, “I love you, ” in Episode V: “I know. ” Fascinating fact: In Lucas’ early drafts of The Star Wars, Solo’s character was Ureallian: a noseless, green-skinned, slime-covered alien with large gills, who trapped Wookiees. Not quite so romantic now, is it? Stream Star Wars now with Amazon Video Appearances: The James Bond series Creator: Ian Fleming Performers: Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig Defining moment: Probably varies by Bond — Moore unzipping Solitaire’s dress with a magnet would sum him up, for example, while Brosnan adjusting his tie after driving a tank through a wall nails him. But it was probably 007’s first film that laid out the marker for the next 50 years, when he shoots Professor Dent with the insouciance of a man who’s just had a bid accepted on eBay. Fascinating fact: The Ian Fleming series of novels and shorts have been almost entirely mined for titles, but these remain available: Risico, The Hildebrand Rarity, The Property Of A Lady, and 007 In New York. They might remain unmined. Stream Dr. No now with Amazon Video Appearances: All four Indiana Jones adventures Creators: George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan Performer: Harrison Ford Defining moment: The flicker of recognition that crosses Indy’s face when Belloq suggests they are alike. Tied with the pained, “Do I really have to do this? ” look he gives just before he shoots the Arab swordsman. Fascinating fact: It is common knowledge that Indiana Jones was originally called Indiana Smith, but changed to Jones at Spielberg’s behest. Yet the reason Spielberg wanted the seemingly negligible name change was to distance Raiders from Nevada Smith, a 1966 Steve McQueen Western.

"Move over, Batman. It may not surprise you to learn that essentially all of the original superheroines dreamt up during the '40s and '50s—including characters that would later become icons like Wonder Woman and Supergirl—were created by male writers and artists for a primarily male audience. And as with all art, since comics are a reflection of the time in which they are made, this occasionally led to some not-so-flattering portrayals of these first female superheroes. In the '60s and '70s, though, thanks to second-wave feminism, we began to see some improvements to women's representation on the page. There was Marvel Girl's transformation into Phoenix and founding Avengers member Wasp's sudden intellectual prowess. And despite the overwhelming lack of female creators and a perceived disinterest in comics from female readers, over time we've seen all kinds of inspiring female superheroes grace our comics, from disco queen Dazzler to former Wakandan queen Storm. "" Despite the overwhelming lack of female creators, over time we've seen all kinds of inspiring female superheroes grace our comics. But just because we've come a long way since the days of "" every woman is naturally the weakest member of her super-team, doesn't mean that the comic book industry has overcome its bent for sexism. For example, despite Marvel's mostly-successful push toward diversity and inclusivity, they once hired an erotica artist to draw a variant cover for the first issue of the new Spider-Woman. Not to mention when the current creative team on DC's New 52 Wonder Woman turned her into an infantilized, pouty bobblehead who was depicted carrying a teddy bear into battle . Not exactly the best way to bring lady readers on board. For all their missteps in representation, though, major comic publishers are making big strides forward. Marvel in particular has a huge range of female-led titles at the moment: Thor! Spider-Gwen! Elektra! Black Widow! Gamora! Silk and Storm feature women of color; Angela: Asgard's Assassin has a trans woman in a major role. Also hugely important is the fact that many of these female-led comics have women on their creative teams, since diversity only *truly matters* if changes are occurring both in front and behind the page. That's to say nothing of the fact that all those comics are being spearheaded by IRL superhero Sana Amanat , Marvel's new Director of Content and Character Development. So how are you to know which comics out there tick the lady-boxes you're looking for? And if you've never picked up a comic book in your life, where do you even begin? Below, a helpful ranking of the most feminist superheroes on the market, complete with easy-to-find starting points. You can pick up these trades at any major bookstore or online retailer these days—but I would recommend you do a quick search online and find your local comic book store. From: Captain Marvel. Where To Start: Captain Marvel Vol. 1 "" Higher, Further, Faster, More , by Kelly Sue DeConnick and David Lopez Now, I might be a bit biased here because Captain Marvel is my favorite superhero, but Captain Marvel is the best superhero. Yeah, I said it. Even before she received her flight and energy-beam superpowers in an alien explosion, Carol Danvers was an Air Force pilot who could and probably would kick your butt. She lives in an apartment at the top of the Statue of Liberty, is best friends with Spider-Woman, and is one of the Avengers. In her most recent run, penned by sass-master Kelly Sue DeConnick, Carol jets off into space with her cat, Chewie to keep an eye on the Avengers' cosmic affairs… and also on the Guardians of the Galaxy, who tend to get themselves into some trouble. She's one of the toughest women on Earth , and she's got a her own movie coming out in 2018—so if you start reading now, you can totally join the Carol Corps and be one of those hipsters who tells everyone that the movie just didn't live up to the comics. One other amazing thing: Captain Marvel used to be a dude character, before Carol took over his powers. Now, she wears his exact same costume, no high heels or deep-V's added. She would roll her eyes at the very suggestion. From: Red Sonja. Where To Start: Red Sonja Vol. 1, "" Queen of Plagues , by Gail Simone and Walter Geovanni Red Sonja is the Viking warrior queen of your dreams, able to booze, bang, or brandish her sword at any moment with ease. Sonja's been around in various forms since 1934, almost a full decade before Wonder Woman lasso'd her way onto the scene, first in the pages of Conan and now in her own solo series. Current writer Gail Simone has described Sonja as "" mayhem, blood, sex, and red hair , and "" lusty, a bit of a drunkard does what she wants, says what she wants, and if you give her any shit, it's entirely possible she'll slay you and your best friend and your best friend's cat. So, you know. She's pretty rad. You can jump right into the current run of Sonja without any background knowledge, though, so don't worry—the story stands on its own. Plus, Walter Geovanni handles Sonja's classic metal beach-wear with aplomb; you won't be seeing any unnecessary cheeks or weird boob-and-butt twists in this run of Red Sonja . She rocks that bikini because it makes her feel hella fierce in battle, not because some dude happens to think she looks hot in it, and she won't let you forget it. From: Batwoman; Where To Start: Batwoman: Elegy , by Greg Rucka and JH. Williams III; New 52 Batwoman Vol. 1 "" Hydrology , by J. H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman There's nothing worse than a female superhero who's all male gaze'd up with gratuitous crotch - shots and poses that are physically impossible if you have internal organs. Lucky for all of us, there's army brat Kate Kane, who would actually jump off the page and kick your face in with her very sturdy flat boots if you even tried to draw her like that. Forced to abandon her military career after she refuses to hide her sexuality, Kane uses her privilege as a moneyed socialite to take on a side gig as Batwoman, vigilante crime-fighter with the best hair in the Bat-family. We don't deserve a queer, ginger, Jewish superheroine, but we definitely need her. If all that Batman stuff has a little too much machismo for your liking, pick up Batwoman; it might be the most serious, adult cape comic on this list, but it keeps things interesting! As an added bonus, Elegy writer Greg Rucka has eloquently taken down misogynists in the geek community with rants decrying the myth of the "" Fake Geek Girl"" —you know, when gatekeeping neckbeards act like women only like comics in order to impress men. Plus, the New 52 team of Williams and Blackman departed the book after twenty-four issues when DC decided they didn't want to see Kate marry her fiancée. From: Saga. Where To Start: Saga Vol. 1 , by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples Alana might not think of herself as a superhero—she has no "" powers"" in the traditional sense—but I certainly do. Caught up on one side of an endless intergalactic war, Alana falls in love with Marko, and together they have a child . But in the Romeo & Juliet -esque twist you may have seen coming, Marko is on the other side of the war, and together the three of them must go to great lengths in order to avoid the massive chaos their union has caused. Saga won Hugo, Eisner, and Harvey awards in 2013 for being so damn awesome, and it includes some of the best portrayals of women in comics of all time. None of them take anyone's crap—Alana least of all. Saga is a true high-sci-fi graphic novel , but don't let that put you off; with beautiful art from Fiona Staples and an excellent story from one of the masters of comic writing, Brian K. Vaughan, the book is a true character study. At its heart, Saga is really just about two literal star-crossed lovers, fighting to save their little family from a war. And Alana will chop the hell out of you with her sword if you so much as glance wrong at Hazel, I swear. From: Rat Queens. Where To Start: Rat Queens Vol. 1 "" Sass and Sorcery , by Kurtis J. Wiebe and Roc Upchurch Creator and writer Kurtis Wiebe has described Rat Queens as Lord of the Rings meets Bridesmaids , and that couldn't be more accurate. Basically, imagine if you and your three best friends found yourselves trapped in a game of Dungeons & Dragons , and you've got this 2014 Eisner Award winner for best new comic series. The four foul-mouthed adventuresses are all unique in their own special ways: Hannah is a rockabilly necromancer with half-sleeves and a tendency to swing a little more Evil than Good; Violet is the dwarven warrior who shaved her beard before it was cool; Dee is the shy human cleric who's still trying to deal with her escape from that awkward Cthulhu-worshipping cult; and Betty is a hippie halfling thief/bartender who really, really loves getting high. Rat Queens passes the Bechdel Test on almost every page without pandering or proselytizing, and it's one of the few comics that will make you laugh out loud constantly. The Rat Queens might not give a damn what you think of them, but I know you're going to love them. From: Squirrel Girl. Where To Start: The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl issue 1 , by Ryan North and Erica Henderson Squirrel Girl is ridiculous. She's just ridiculous! There's no getting around it. She's a girl with the equivalent physical powers of a squirrel, and she can also talk to squirrels. The great thing about the current run of The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is that writer Ryan North knows all this, and embraces Doreen's ridiculousness with all the love she deserves. Easily the funniest comic superhero comic out there right now , Squirrel Girl follows Doreen's adventures as she starts college with her pet squirrel Tippy Toe, like meeting her new knitting-obsessed roomie, signing up for clubs, crushing on cute boys, defeating Galactus—you know, the usual. Also, Doreen hides her conspicuous squirrel tail in the back of her pants, which Erica Henderson uses to her advantage by drawing Squirrel Girl in the most body-positive, bootylicious way possible. "" I like to draw heartier super ladies, if their powers are mostly physical, because I feel like I shouldn't be able to take down a super hero by sitting on her, Henderson said. Preach. Comic history bonus time: Back in 2005, Squirrel Girl single-handedly defeated Thanos—you know, big scary purple Josh Brolin from Guardians of the Galaxy —with squirrels. Never underestimate Squirrel Girl, friends. From: Batgirl. Where To Start: Batgirl Vol. 1 "" The Batgirl of Burnside , by Cameron Stewart, Brenden Fletcher, and Babs Tarr After recovering from a spinal injury that left her paralyzed for three years, Barbara Gordon has just graduated from college with a degree in forensic psychology and is living the typical early-twenties life in Burnside, Gotham's very own version of Brooklyn. Sorry, did I say typical? I meant that she's trying to navigate the waters of having a normal life while also attempting to bring down a psychopath with a revenge porn ring so twisted it will make you want to set up two-step verification on every account you have, immediately. Babs rocks the most functional crime-fighting outfit ever seen in comics , and she's not scared to snap a selfie post-smackdown. She's you, if you just also happened to have an eidetic memory and a black belt. As a bonus, the book's current creative team is outspoken in their love for feminism and diversity in comics, and they responded incredibly well to some recent controversy over their representation of trans characters . Plus, Babs Tarr's art makes the Burnside crew look like they belong in the next episode of Broad City . If you're looking to pick up your first DC cape book, I recommend waiting a few months for the first Burnside trade—and then you'll be hooked for life. From: Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Where To Start: Buffy Season Eight Vol. 1 "" The Long Way Home, by Joss Whedon and Georges Jeanty "" Wait, I can hear you say through your screen, "" didn't Buffy end after seven seasons way back in 2003? So you might think— if you limit yourself to the medium of television—but you would in fact be mistaken. Buffy paved the way for badass women on-screen in the late '90s , and she continues to be just as pioneering and perky in comic books today. The first volume of Buffy Season Eight picks up not long after the series finale and continues to tell the story of all your Buffy faves, including Xander, Willow, Giles, and Faith . Whedon has admitted that, without the restraints of a small-screen VFX budget, they may have gone a bit off the deep end, creatively , but doesn't everyone want to see what Buffy Summers would have done with her life after leaving the remains of Sunnydale? And have Buffy go on and on and never end? Thanks to the miracle of comics, we get just that: they're currently in the midst of Buffy season ten. Yes, our favorite '90s feminist icon can live forever. From: Sex Criminals. Where To Start: Sex Criminals Vol. 1, "" One Weird Trick , by Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky For some people, it might feel like time metaphorically stops when you have sex; but for Suze, it literally does. Whenever she achieves the big O, everything freezes, and Suze can wander freely around what she calls "" The Quiet. When she meets Jon and discovers he can do the exact same thing , they decide to sexploit their newfound powers as a couple to do what you'd normally do with time-stopping powers: drop a stinky gift in your awful boss's potted plant, take epically long baths, and rob banks. But Suze and Jon aren't the only people who can find their way to The Quiet—the Sex Police, led by one Kegel Face, are after them, and our intrepid couple have to find their way out of some pretty unsexy trouble. Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky are comedic masters, and Suze's narration is completely natural and relatable. Sure, the book is vulgar, but not in the ways you might think. Plus, the end of every volume of Sex Criminals comes with a series of sex tips , including helpful hints like "" Nipple clamps are excellent for keeping nipples in place, "" Butt stuff, and "" Have sex with me please. Nailed it. From: Ms. Marvel. Where To Start: Ms. Marvel Vol. 1 "" No Normal , by G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona Kamala Khan has changed the face of superhero comics forever. A fifteen-year-old Muslim Pakistani American girl in Jersey City, Kamala obsesses over the Avengers , finds her strict parents tough to deal with, and struggles to fit in like any other teen. After sneaking out to a party one night, Kamala finds herself engulfed in a mysterious fog that bestows upon her epic powers of shape-shifting and healing. She grows into her powers as she grows into her own self, learning what it means to be "" super"" in more ways than one. And she still has to go to high school. Ugh. Ms. Marvel is written by G. Willow Wilson , and is full of hilarious, you-spend-half-your-life-on-the-internet references that will have you falling in love with Kamala before you can say, "" Wow, such superhero, very inhuman. Watch her fangirl over Wolverine in-person, start on her journey of self-discovery, and fight for the reputation of an entire generation, all while trying to heed advice from her parents and religious leaders. Sam Maggs is an Associate Editor for The Mary Sue and was named "" Awesome Geek Feminist of the Year"" by Women Write About Comics .

"Any fan of stories that involve juicy subjects like adultery, gambling, marriage plots, and, well, Russian feudalism, would instantly place Anna Karenina at the peak of their “greatest novels” list. And that’s exactly the ranking that publications like Time magazine have given the novel since it was published in its entirety in 1878. Written by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy , the eight-part towering work of fiction tells the story of two major characters: a tragic, disenchanted housewife, the titular Anna, who runs off with her young lover, and a lovestruck landowner named Konstantin Levin, who struggles in faith and philosophy. Tolstoy molds together thoughtful discussions on love, pain, and family in Russian society with a sizable cast of characters regarded for their realistic humanity. The novel was especially revolutionary in its treatment of women, depicting prejudices and social hardships of the time with vivid emotion. Harper Lee , believed to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed, famously published only a single novel . Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named Jean Louise Finch. Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer and father Atticus Finch, served as role models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time when tensions regarding race were high. To Kill a Mockingbird earned the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961 and was made into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962, giving the story and its characters further life and influence over the American social sphere. F. Scott Fitzgerald ’s The Great Gatsby is distinguished as one of the greatest texts for introducing students to the art of reading literature critically . The novel is told from the perspective of a young man named Nick Carraway who has recently moved to New York City and is befriended by his eccentric nouveau riche neighbor with mysterious origins, Jay Gatsby. The Great Gatsby provides an insider’s look into the Jazz Age of the 1920s in United States history while at the same time critiquing the idea of the “American Dream. ” Perhaps the most-famous aspect of the novel is its cover art—a piercing face projected onto a dark blue night sky and lights from a cityscape—an image that is also found, in a slightly different configuration, within the text itself as a key symbol. The late Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez published his most-famous work, One Hundred Years of Solitude , in 1967. The novel tells the story of seven generations of the Buendía family and follows the establishment of their town Macondo until its destruction along with the last of the family’s descendents. In fantastical form, the novel explores the genre of magic realism by emphasizing the extraordinary nature of commonplace things while mystical things are shown to be common. Márquez highlights the prevalence and power of myth and folktale in relating history and Latin American culture. The novel won many awards for Márquez, leading the way to his eventual honor of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982 for his entire body of work, of which One Hundred Years of Solitude is often lauded as his most triumphant. E. M. Forster wrote his novel A Passage to India after multiple trips to the country throughout his early life. The book was published in 1924 and follows a Muslim Indian doctor named Aziz and his relationships with an English professor, Cyril Fielding, and a visiting English schoolteacher named Adela Quested. When Adela believes that Aziz has assaulted her while on a trip to the Marabar caves near the fictional city of Chandrapore, where the story is set, tensions between the Indian community and the colonial British community rise. The possibility of friendship and connection between English and Indian people, despite their cultural differences and imperial tensions, is explored in the conflict. The novel’s colorful descriptions of nature, the landscape of India, and the figurative power that they are given within the text solidifies it as a great work of fiction. Often confused with H. G. Wells’s science-fiction novella of nearly the same name , Ralph Ellison ’s Invisible Man is a groundbreaking novel in the expression of identity for the African American male. The narrator of the novel, a man who is never named but believes he is “invisible” to others socially, tells the story of his move from the South to college and then to New York City. In each location he faces extreme adversity and discrimination, falling into and out of work, relationships, and questionable social movements in a wayward and ethereal mindset. The novel is renowned for its surreal and experimental style of writing that explores the symbolism surrounding African American identity and culture. Invisible Man won the U. S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1953. Miguel de Cervantes ’s Don Quixote , perhaps the most influential and well-known work of Spanish literature, was first published in full in 1615. The novel, which is very regularly regarded as one of the best literary works of all time, tells the story of a man who takes the name “Don Quixote de la Mancha” and sets off in a fit of obsession over romantic novels about chivalry to revive the custom and become a hero himself. The character of Don Quixote has become an idol and somewhat of an archetypal character, influencing many major works of art, music, and literature since the novel’s publication. The text has been so influential that a word, quixotic , based on the Don Quixote character, was created to describe someone who is, “foolishly impractical especially in the pursuit of ideals; especially: marked by rash lofty romantic ideas or extravagantly chivalrous action. ” Toni Morrison ’s 1987 spiritual and haunting novel Beloved tells the story of an escaped slave named Sethe who has fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, in the year 1873. The novel investigates the trauma of slavery even after freedom has been gained, depicting Sethe’s guilt and emotional pain after having killed her own child, whom she named Beloved, to keep her from living life as a slave. A spectral figure appears in the lives of the characters and goes by the same name as the child, embodying the family’s anguish and hardship and making their feelings and past unavoidable. The novel was lauded for addressing the psychological effects of slavery and the importance of family and community in healing. Beloved was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988. Possibly the most idiosyncratic novel of this list, Virginia Woolf ’s Mrs. Dalloway describes exactly one day in the life of a British socialite named Clarissa Dalloway. Using a combination of a third-person narration and the thoughts of various characters, the novel uses a stream-of-consciousness style all the way through. The result of this style is a deeply personal and revealing look into the characters’ minds, with the novel relying heavily on character rather than plot to tell its story. The thoughts of the characters include constant regrets and thoughts of the past, their struggles with mental illness and post-traumatic stress from World War I, and the effect of social pressures. The novel’s unique style, subject, and time setting make it one of the most respected and regarded works of all time. The Western canon of “great literature” often focuses on writers who come from North America or Europe and often ignores accomplished writers and amazing works of literature from other parts of the world. Chinua Achebe ’s Things Fall Apart , published in 1958, is one such work of African literature that had to overcome the bias of some literary circles and one that has been able to gain recognition worldwide despite it. The novel follows an Igbo man named Okonkwo, describing his family, the village in Nigeria where he lives, and the effects of British colonialism on his native country. The novel is an example of African postcolonial literature, a genre that has grown in size and recognition since the mid-1900s as African people have been able to share their often unheard stories of imperialism from the perspective of the colonized. The novel is frequently assigned for reading in courses on world literature and African studies. Charlotte Brontë ’s Jane Eyre , another novel often assigned for reading in school, was initially published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell to disguise the fact that the writer was a woman. Fortunately, a lot has changed with regard to women in literature since 1847, and Brontë now receives the credit she deserves for one of the most-groundbreaking novels about women in history. At a time when the author felt compelled to hide her true identity, Jane Eyre provided a story of individualism for women. The novel’s eponymous character rises from being orphaned and poor into a successful and independent woman. The work combines themes from both Gothic and Victorian literature, revolutionizing the art of the novel by focusing on the growth in Jane’s sensibility with internalized action and writing. Though the epistolary novel was most popular before the 19th century, Alice Walker became a champion of the style with her 1982 Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning novel The Color Purple . Set in the post-Civil War American South, the novel follows a young African American girl named Celie into adulthood in letters she writes to God and to her sister Nettie. Celie faces sexual abuse by her father and eventually her husband, chronicling her own suffering and growth as well as that of her friends and family. The novel explores themes of sexism, racism, gender, sexual orientation, and disability through its grouping of disadvantaged and damaged characters who, over time, grow to shape their own lives. The story was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film in 1985 that, despite widespread critical acclaim, was notoriously snubbed of all 11 awards it was nominated for.

"CNET también está disponible en español. Don't show this again Famed comic book creator Stan Lee created over 300 characters while working at Marvel as a writer and then as editor in chief. As we look back at his incredible legacy following his passing , here are some of his most famous characters both in and out of the filmic universe, including Spider-Man, Black Panther, Hulk, Black Widow and Doctor Strange. As founder of the X-Men, Charles Xavier/ Professor X created and runs a school to teach young mutants how to understand and control their powers so they can live among humans without being a threat. Lee was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. to make a superhero who tries to broker peace between mutants and humans. Billionaire Tony Stark might seem like a snarky playboy, but he's also a genius when it comes to technology and science. After suffering a life-threatening heart injury while kidnapped by captors who try to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape. He later modifies his new super-suit with weapons and tech from his company Stark Industries. As Iron Man, Stark protects fellow humans from super villains, invading aliens and more. He's one of the founding members of the Avengers. Clinton Francis "" Clint"" Barton/ Hawkeye began as a reluctant foe to Iron Man, but later teamed up with the Avengers. While Hawkeye doesn't possess superhuman powers, he is an expert marksman with his bow and arrow. He's also highly trained in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. The Hulk is the alter ego of the physicist Robert Bruce Banner . The giant green superhero may have anger management issues, but he's one of the most memorable superheroes Lee created. Lee was heavily influenced by the classic stories of Frankenstein, as well as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Hulk/Banner is also one of the founding members of the Avengers. This was the first superhero group created by Stan Lee . The Fantastic Four consists of Mister Fantastic/Reed Richards, Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, the Human Torch/Johnny Storm, and the Thing/Ben Grimm. The characters were all departures from typical superheroes in that they dealt with self-doubt, self-sabotage and the kind of flaws that made them even more relatable to fans. The Fantastic Four have had movies in both 2005 and 2015 , though neither is part of the MCU. While Lee didn't invent Norse god Thor, he did decide to transform the mythical god into a superhero who lives on the planet Asgard. Thor fearlessly fights with his trusty hammer Mjolnir and can control lightning. He's also one of the founding members of the Avengers. Dr. Victor Von Doom/Doctor Doom is the archenemy of the Fantastic Four. He's also fought superheroes Spider-Man, Iron Man and Black Panther, to name a few. This super villain also happens to be a scientific genius who can take technopathic control over machines called Doombots. His impressive armor gives him superhuman strength. As the first black superhero in mainstream American comic books, T'Challa/ Black Panther is king of the fictional African nation Wakanda. Black Panther is highly trained in hand-to-hand combat and knowledgeable in science and uses advance tech to fight foes. He also has enhanced abilities such as super-human senses, strength, agility and healing powers gained through ancient Wakandan rituals. Born with superhuman abilities, Max Eisenhardt/ Magneto has the ability to generate and control magnetic fields. In the comics, he's levitated everything from asteroids to submarines using his powers. Unlike Professor X's pacifist attitude toward humans, Magneto is more aggressive in his approach to mutants gaining their civil rights. He regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans. His character is played by Ian McKellen in the 2006 movie X-Men: The Last Stand and by Michael Fassbender in the 2011 movie X-Men: First Class . Natalia "" Natasha"" Romanova/ Black Widow was a Russian spy and adversary to Iron Man. She ultimately defected to the United States and joined S. H. I. E. L. D. Later, she became an important member of the Avengers. She's an expert martial artist and tactician and has an impressive talent for psychological manipulation. Created by both Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Stephen Strange began as a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon who undergoes a spiritual transformation after a debilitating car accident causes him to search for alternative methods to heal. Training with the Ancient One leads Doctor Strange to not only gain enlightenment but also superhero-level powers through magic. Here he is portrayed by actor Benedict Cumberbatch in the 2016 movie Doctor Strange . Former soldier Nick Fury was introduced to readers in a World War II combat comic book series, but was later brought into modern day as the director of S. H. I. E. L. D. He's an expert in martial arts, weapons, vehicles and demolitions. He lost vision in his left eye in combat, so he covers it with his signature eye patch. When lawyer Jennifer Walters gets an emergency blood transfusion from her cousin Dr. Bruce Banner, she ends up getting a milder case of his Hulk condition. While Banner struggles with controlling his anger when turning into the Hulk, Walters can keep her emotions in check when she transforms into She-Hulk . In the comics, She-Hulk has been a member of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the Defenders and S. H. I. E. L. D. Scott Summers/Cyclops was born as a mutant who can emit powerful energy beams from his eyes. Since he can't control the energy he must don special eyewear at all times. He's also a founding member of the X-Men . Here's actor Tye Sheridan playing the character in the 2016 movie "" X-Men: Apocalypse . Matt Murdock might be blind after a childhood accident, but that just made his other senses extra keen. Daredevil been dubbed "" The Man Without Fear"" for good reason. His training in martial arts transformed him into the kind of lawyer-by-day, vigilante-by-night superhero who makes sure justice isn't blind. Starting as a villain to the X-Men, Wanda Maximoff/ Scarlet Witch and her twin brother Pietro Maximoff/ Quicksilver left the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and eventually fought side by side with the Avengers. She's a powerful sorceress who can hex her foes, manipulate magic and alter reality. She's played by Elizabeth Olson in the 2015 movie Avengers: Age of Ultron and the more recent Avengers: Infinity War . Once an ordinary, geeky teenager, Peter Parker accidentally became a superhero after a run-in with a radioactive spider. Created by both Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Spider-Man was an unusual superhero in that he was without a mentor as he figured out how to utilize his powers on his own, which wasn't easy when battling villains like Doc Ock or Green Goblin. When he's not fighting evil, he's dealing with the usual problems of adolescence like love, friendship and high school. In the comics, Ant-Man was originally Hank Pym , a genius scientist who invented a superhero suit using subatomic "" Pym particles"" that allowed whoever wore the outfit to significantly alter his size -- often being able to shrink to the size of an insect. Pym also created a cybernetic helmet that lets him talk with ants and other insects. He serves as a member of the Avengers and can be seen in this summer's Ant-Man & the Wasp .

The resurgence of Dungeons & Dragons . The enduring popularity of all things Lord of the Rings . We’re currently in a fantasy renaissance. But unfortunately, aside from some rare exceptions – notably Jason Aaron & Mike Del Mundo’s Weirdworld at Marvel – comic books still remain largely fantasy-free. And that’s a shame. Because back in the 70s, comic books had more crazy fantasy than the custom-airbrushed van that’s always hanging out at your local hydroponics shop. Collected below are our 11 favorite 70s fantasy comic book characters, but if you think we missed someone, make sure to tell us all about it, in painstaking, irate detail, in the most apoplectic manner imaginable, down in the comments below. Ok. So Conan the Barbarian wasn’t actually created in the 1970s – Robert E. Howard first wrote about the scowling Cimmerian way back in 1932. But Conan didn’t come roaring into comics until 1970, when, courtesy of all-star talent like Barry Windsor-Smith, John Buscema, Roy Thomas, Neal Adams and man, many others. The original Conan comics – of which there were multiple series – took the classic Conan stories as a starting point, and used them to springboard off in a number of different fantastical directions and even introduce additional fantasy characters… Red Sonja was kinda based on a Robert E. Howard character as well. I say “kinda” because though she shares a similar-sounding name to Red Sonya of Rogatino, she’s actually an amalgam of that character, another Howard creation and some elements of Roy Thomas’ own invention, resulting in the character actually being owned by a separate company than the rest of Howard’s roster of badasses. But all that’s beside the point, because since her creation, Red Sonja has grown into a kind of brutal feminist icon, boasting amazing martial abilities and an oath to never sleep with a man unless he can best her in combat. Red Sonja wasn’t the only character to make the jump from literature to Marvel’s Conan series. Witness Elric of Melnibone. I’ve written at length about my love for Michael Moorcock’s most famous creation , so it should come as no surprise that I love his appearances in comics as well, starting with issues 14 and 15 of Conan the Barbarian . While I still prefer Moorcock’s psychedelic prose to any of Elric’s comic book appearances, at the end of the day, you’re still getting an albino sorcerer emperor with a soul-stealing sword…what’s not to like? In the mid-70s, with fires of fantasy fandom raging, DC Comics started a slew of new sword and sorcery titles . Among them, however, was Claw the Unconquered , which, on the surface, appeared to be little more than a knock-off of Marvel’s massively popular Conan comics. Claw brought additional wrinkles to the barbarian archetype, however, courtesy of a deformed, magical, cursed hand that was shaped like, you guessed it, a claw. Jean Girard, better known by his frequent penname Moebius, is a comic book legend – and for good reason. He is renowned for his western Blueberry , his work with Alejandro Jodorowsky on The Incal , the best Silver Surfer story ever with Stan Lee, The Airtight Garage and many, many more. But personally, my favorite Moebius work will always be Arzach . It’s the mostly wordless story of a guy with a cape and a crazy hat, riding around on a flying dinosaur, peeping in on women, ruining relationships and getting up to all kinds of fever-dream-esque fantasy weirdness. If any of that sounds familiar to you, you might have seen the Arzach-inspired final sequence of the Heavy Metal movie, which was loosely based upon the French magazine Metal Hurlant , where the Arzach stories first appeared. Another one of the fantasy comics that DC launched in the mid-70s, Warlord provides an entirely different twist on the barbarian sword and sorcery story. Instead of being a native to his savage world, the Warlord was actually Vietnam veteran and pilot Travis Morgan, who arrived in the fantastical world of Skartaris by way of a hole at the north pole that led him inside the Earth. It’s a zany set-up for sure, but it led to exceptionally brutal, amazingly fun run of fantasy comics from cartoonist Mike Grell. While Warlord is the most famous example of the formula, he wasn’t comics’ first modern-day pilot turned fantasy world warrior. No, that honor goes to Marvel’s James Patrick Scully, aka Skull the Slayer, who debuted in his own comic a full three months before Warlord. Like his DC counterpart, Skull steered his plane into a shocking, savage world, but traded “hole in the north pole” for “Bermuda Triangle” and “impossible world inside of the Earth” for “another Earth entirely. ” Plus, Skull has a leg up on Warlord by virtue of the power belt he finds, which turns him into a legit superhuman. These days, Arkon is best known as the barbaric hero of Aaron & Del Mundo’s aforementioned Weirdworld series at Marvel, but he’s actually a much older character, first appearing in Avengers #75 way back in 1970. As the war-crazed ruler of Polemachus – a world that exists in a different dimension from the regular Marvel Universe – Arkon clashed with the Avengers over various schemes that were invariably rooted in his need to destroy the Earth in order to safeguard his people. Jean Van Hamme is perhaps best known for his spy and amnesia series XIII , but with artist Grzegorz Rosinski he created Thorgal , a wide-reaching fantasy series that is one of the most popular French language comics of all time. Thorgal is a viking, but also the grandson of an alien who crash landed on Earth. The series follows him and his tribe, weaving in elements of history, science fiction and mythology into its heady fantasy brew. Stalker was probably the weirdest of all the releases in DC’s mid-70s fantasy push and not coincidentally, also my favorite. Unfortunately, it only ran four issues. But within those four issues, future DC President Paul Levitz and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko created something dark, grim and bizzare: The Stalker. He is a warrior that is immortal, but bereft of a soul, and must fight through demonic netherworlds in a quest to get it back. If any character on this list is ripe for a comeback, it’s the Stalker. The sole non-human character on this list, Cerebus is one of comics’ finest creations. Though often overshadowed by creator Dave Sim’s problematic views on, well…most things, the long-running Cerebus series is a work to behold. Though it began as a simple Conan parody, focusing on the adventurers of a barbarian aardvark, it quickly evolved into something much deeper and more complex, as Sim used his expansive world to muse on politics, religion, love, life, art and a billion other topics before bringing the series to a close after 300 issues and 27 years. If any of these sounded as rad to you as they do to me, hit up your local comic book shop and start digging for back issues – you can probably find most of them for extremely cheap.

"As a child, I was obsessed with names. I bought myself an enormous book of baby names which remains to this day the most annotated text I own. But I wasn’t obsessed with babies. Just names. Names for pets, names for dolls, names for characters in games and stories and drawings. NAAAAAMES. So here are some of my favorite names in literature. Not all of them, of course, because there are far too many. But some. Some really, really good ones. 1. Lancelot Satterwhite – Fates and Furies by Lauren Groff Image Via Wikipedia Many characters in Groff’s triumphant, sprawling novel have excellent or at least unusual names: Denton Thrasher , Gwennie, Chollie, Mathilde, but the trophy goes to the protagonist Lancelot Satterwhite. What a name. Many of the monikers that crop up in this novel are almost too good to be true, by which I mean, if it were any other text that deals with the human condition from differing perspectives, such names would take the reader out of the text, would render the story ever so slightly unbelievable, make it seem untrue. However, Groff’s names only add another element of dreaminess and impressiveness to her beautiful, ambitious book. While Lancelot is commonly associated with the royal and impressive, the name Satterwhite is not one I had encountered before. According to Genealogy. com, the name means settlement in the thwaite or woodland clearing. ‘The Satterwhites were Norsemen who first migrated to England and then on to America. ’ By directly referencing the family’s origins and specific location in the name, Groff could be drawing a contrast between it and Lancelot’s constant search for belonging. A king with no throne. 2. Dido Twite – Black Hearts in Battersea and Nightbirds on Nantucket by Joan Aiken Images Via Amazon and Pinterest Oh look, she is talking about Joan Aiken again. “What a surprise, ” you say. Soon I will have converted you all to the wonders of the Aiken-verse. Soon. Perhaps once you’ve read about precocious urchin Dido Twite you too will become a loyal follower. Dido, a Cockney orphan, befriends my first literary crush, artist, and bee-keeper Simon, when he moves to London to study art after the events of The Wolves of Willoughby Chase . She is: a shrewish-looking little creature of perhaps eight or nine, with sharp eyes of a pale washed-out blue and no eyebrows or eyelashes to speak of. Her straw-coloured hair was stringy and sticky with jam and she wore a dirty satin dress two sizes too small for her. She is hilarious, infuriating, smart, and goes on to be the protagonist of several more novels in the Wolves sequence. In Greek mythology, Dido was the founder of Carthage and while the idea of Dido being at all royal or divine seems at the beginning laughable, as her story progresses, her hidden depths justify her great name. 3. Lucius Reeve – The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt Image Via Goodreads Donna Tartt is another author who excels not only in the field of writing in general, but specifically in the naming of characters. The Goldfinch is one of my favorite books of all time. It’s a vast, ambitious tome that moves between New York and Los Vegas, loss and friendship, crime and love. It contains characters called things like Hobie, Xandra, and Kitsy . Lucius Reeve is, as you might expect, a slimy antiques dealer. He is a fairly minor character in the great scheme of the novel, but he is so aptly named. Granted, there are not that many friendly Luciuses in fiction *glares accusingly at Lucius Malfoy* but that is because it just such an appropriately bad name. It sounds almost like luscious but can also be made into a spiteful hiss of an utterance. Apologies to any Luciuses reading. It’s not my fault you’re evil. 4. Bustopher Jones – Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. Image Via Amazon A character in T. S. Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats , and later in the Broadway musical Cats! Here are some things to know about the wonderfully named Bustopher Jones: Bustopher Jones is not skin and bones – / In fact, he’s remarkably fat…No commonplace mousers have such well-cut trousers / And we’re all of us proud to be nodded or bowed to / By Bustopher Jones in white spats! Bustopher is one of many marvelously titled felines in Eliot’s poetry collection, along with Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, and Skimbleshanks among others. I like Bustopher Jones because it’s a terribly pleasing, round-sounding name that evokes the smug swagger of a life-loving cat. I also like him because I like the mention of trousers in his poem. When I was small, my godmother had two cats, Trousers and Puddings. When left alone in the house, Trousers would turn on the taps, the radio and the heating and have himself a good party. Puddings did not participate. As an adult, I learned her name was not actually Puddings, but Shitless. Because she was scared shitless of everything. I had been lied to. 5. Coriander – I, Coriander by Sally Gardner Image Via Wikipedia Coriander, or as it is referred to in the US, cillantro, is a controversial herb. People get tattoos about how much they love or hate it. I am reasonably indifferent to coriander as a seasoning, but I love it as a name and I adore Sally Gardner’s novel. Coriander is not exactly a divisive character, but hers is an un-Christian name and there is an attempt made to get her to change it to Ann. Coriander is nine for much of the plot. Nine and a bit lost and also caught in the midst of fairy activity and the political intrigue of Puritan London. It’s a pretty cool mixture and a pretty cool book with a pretty cool name. I don’t think I had highlighted, noted and researched any of these names in my studying of the precious names book. In fact, most of these names weren’t even featured so that’s why I take such great delight in these ones- the absurd, the evocative, the unusual. NAAAAAMES.

"Because being creative for World Book Day 2019 doesn't have to be a mad panic World Book Day 2019 is looming and your child wants to impress with a brilliant home-made creation. And this year you've vowed that you won't rely on the supermarkets and instead get creative - but you simply have no idea how to transform your kid into his or her's favourite book character. And you'll no doubt leave it to the last minute to sort something too. But, delve deep enough into your cupboards, and you might find that putting something together is not quite as hard as you think. It's being held on Thursday, March 7. Here is our guide on who to choose to dress up as and how to have a panic-less hunt for a brilliant costume - without a needle and thread in sight. Roald Dahl’s sweet character is very easy to sort. Just put your daughter in a blue dress, with a red ribbon in her hair and carrying a pile of books. Put your boy in a dress. Yes, that’s all. All you need is a black eye mask but if you don’t have one of those you could use face paint – or mascara, if you have an old one knocking about. Then dress them in a ‘granny-style’ cardigan or blouse, a black skirt, old slippers and a pair of wrinkly tights. Then grab a sack that would work as a swag bag. If you don’t have a grey wig, put some talcum powder in their hair. This is great if you have a son called George. If not, don’t worry – you can put a name tag on them. Then give them a big saucepan Simple. All you need is a blue jumper, some hair gel for his famous quiff and if you’ve got a white stuffed dog to be Snowey, even better. If your little princess enjoys ballet, chances are she already has a pink leotard and tutu. Add a pink hair bow and some ears if you have them but if not, simply cut out some pink ears from a piece of car and tape them to a hairband – the perfect little dancing mouse. If you have a red and white striped jumper in your wardrobe, this is the perfect time to get it out. Match it with a bobble hat and some black round-rimmed glasses and you have Wally. If you don’t have a stripy jumper, you could use tape some red stripes across a white T-shirt. Harry wears a red top and blue trousers and walks around with a bucketful of dinos. If you have a bucket and some toys dinosaurs, you’re laughing. The only props you will need are glasses for Harry, some face paint for his scar and a black cape, which often comes on a Halloween outfit. Then you’ll need a white shirt with normal school trousers and perhaps a drumstick for a magic wand. Who doesn’t love the cute bear from Peru? If you child is a fan, you will need a duffel coat, a black soft hat, red welly boots, an old suitcase and a marmalade sandwich. This is very easy. Just put them in a white T-shirt, black shorts and team it with a black rucksack. You need a big pair of white Y-fronts, a red cape and a very brave boy to carry this one off. Or he could, of course, pop the pants over his trousers! All you need is a brown or black dress or top and skirt and a candlestick as a prop. Finish the outfit off with one of Jacqueline Wilson's Hetty Feather books. Got a witches hat in the attic? Yes, then all you’ll need to finish the look is a red top and purple skift. You could use a sweeping brush as the broom and a bucket as the cauldron. And if you are feeling really creative, attach a frog and a cat to the brush for extra effect. The popular Lauren Child character is a good one for last-minute panics. Just put your daughter in a flowery dress or a navy pinafore dress, with a white shirt underneath and you have one of her looks. This is great for football fans who don’t really like dressing up. They just need white shirts, a red or navy football shirt and a black cape. Then, on paper, draw the SSB logo and stick on the back. If you haven’t got the props to dress them as Willy Wonka, Charlie is an easy option. All they need is scruffy clothes and a handmade golden ticket. If you’re happy to part with some of the house supply of loo roll or kitchen roll, dress them in blue and then get creative. Use bandages or plaster if you’d prefer but loo roll is a good last-minute choice. Got some yellow wool that granny gave you and you’ve never learnt to knit with? Then, make a long plait out of the wool and attach to a ponytail for a quick transformation. Another of the Mr Men classics, they will need an oversized pink jumper. Fill it with a cushion and then belt it underneath to keep it in. Get a white T-shirt and draw spots on it with a black felt tip. If you have black face paint, paint a nose on them too. If naughty Bill is your child’s favourite, just dress them in ordinary trousers, a striped top and a flat cap. Maybe you have an old eyemask from an aeroplane they can use – if so, cut holes into it so they can see and give them a swag bag for a number one thief. For the pig’s snout, just use a takeaway cup, paint it pink with two circles at the front for the nostrils. Put two holes in either side, add some elastic and make sure it fits around your child’s head. Make pink ears with some pink card and dress them in pink, with some dungarees and black shoes. Have your child wear a black skirt with a white blouse tucked in. They’ll also need a little white maid-type apron and an umbrella for extra effect. Use black tracksuit bottoms and white T-shirt, with a black cardigan . Make a red bow out of ribbon and construct a mini top hat if you can. Paint your child’s face white and add whiskers. Make a ‘revolting’ beard with brown wool of various lengths knotted onto elastic that can fasten around your child’s head. Get your child to draw different food stuffs onto paper, cut them out and stick them onto the beard. They need to look dirty and dishevelled, so have them wear old clothes with splodges of brown paint that looks like dirt. If you don’t mind using a pack of cards from home, this is a fab costume idea. All your child needs to wear is a white top with black skirt. Cut out some red paper hearts and stick them all over the outfit, then fan out the heart cards from the pack and stick them together with tape. Then, stick some ribbon or string to the corners, tie your child’s hair into a bun and clip the card crown in piece, tying the ribbon around the bun. Dress them in a yellow collared T-shirt with red top. Get a straw hat and make a red paper feather to stick in the side. Then add a blue ribbon around the collar and make a long nose by rolling a piece of paper into a cone shape and securing with elastic bands. If you have a blue and yellow stripy jumper, you’re sorted. If not, try and add some stripes yourself and match them with blue trousers and trainers. If your son is older and is a 007 fan after reading the novels, and you are lucky enough to have been to a wedding or posh event recently, then dress him in his smartest togs as the super spy. We wouldn’t recommend stilts for this one but you can still get them to look like the lovable Roald Dahl character with some baggy trousers, a brown waistcoat and a big baggy shirt Make some big ears by cutting out an ear shape using pink paper, then stick them onto a headband. Find a little doll to be Sophie for them to put in their hand or shirt pocket.
